# mcp.json

**Path**: `.cursor\mcp.json`

## Summary
This is a configuration file for MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers, which defines server connections that can be used for AI/LLM integrations. The file currently contains an empty `mcpServers` object, indicating no MCP servers are configured yet. This serves as a placeholder or initialization file for future MCP server configurations that would enable the application to connect to external AI services or custom server implementations.
