**Path**: `.eslintrc.js`

## Summary
This is an ESLint configuration file that sets up JavaScript linting rules for a Sylius e-commerce platform project. It extends the Airbnb base style guide, configures specific code style rules (like object shorthand usage and max line length of 120 characters), and defines import path aliases that map to Sylius vendor bundle directories for cleaner imports across the codebase.
