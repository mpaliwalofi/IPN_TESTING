# .stylelintrc.json

**Path**: `.stylelintrc.json`

## Summary
This is a Stylelint configuration file that sets up CSS/SCSS linting rules for a project using Tailwind CSS. It extends several standard configurations for HTML, SCSS, property ordering (Recess), and Prettier compatibility, while specifically allowing Tailwind's custom at-rules (@tailwind, @layer, @value) that would otherwise be flagged as unknown SCSS directives. The configuration ensures consistent styling and formatting of stylesheets while accommodating Tailwind's utility-first CSS framework syntax.
