# .yarnrc.yml

**Path**: `.yarnrc.yml`

## Summary
This is a Yarn package manager configuration file that specifies the node linker strategy. It configures Yarn to use the traditional `node-modules` folder structure for dependency installation, rather than Yarn's newer PnP (Plug'n'Play) system, ensuring compatibility with tools and workflows that expect the classic Node.js module resolution.
