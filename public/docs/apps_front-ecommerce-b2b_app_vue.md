# app.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce-b2b\app.vue`

## Summary
This is the root application component for a B2B e-commerce front-end built with Nuxt.js. It initializes the reCAPTCHA helper for bot protection across the application and sets up the core layout structure with a loading indicator (styled in beige #E1DBD5) and nested routing through NuxtLayout and NuxtPage components. This serves as the entry point that wraps all pages and layouts in the B2B e-commerce application.
