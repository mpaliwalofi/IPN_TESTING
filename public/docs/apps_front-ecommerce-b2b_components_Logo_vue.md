# Logo.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce-b2b\components\Logo.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders the company logo as an inline SVG graphic for a B2B e-commerce application. The SVG contains multiple path elements that form the visual shape of the "Ultra" brand logo (visible from the path coordinates and the file context), providing a scalable vector graphic that can be reused throughout the application's interface.
