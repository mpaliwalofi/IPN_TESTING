# MiniCartHeader.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce-b2b\components\MiniCartHeader.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component displays a mini cart header for a B2B ecommerce application that shows minimum order amount requirements. It calculates and displays the maximum amount threshold from the cart's validity rules, and conditionally shows an error warning if the cart doesn't meet validity requirements (likely when the order total is below the minimum threshold).
