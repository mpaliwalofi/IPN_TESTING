## Summary
This is a French localization file for a B2B e-commerce application, specifically for a pet food company (Ultra Premium Professionnel). It defines French URL route mappings and translations for various pages including product catalogs, user account management (animals, orders, subscriptions), checkout flows, and a pet food guide feature. The file enables French-language URL slugs like "/panier/" (cart), "/mon-compte/" (my account), and "/croquettes/" (kibble) to support the French market version of the application.
