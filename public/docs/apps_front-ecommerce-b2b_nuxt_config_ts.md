# nuxt.config.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce-b2b\nuxt.config.ts`

## Summary
This is a Nuxt.js configuration file for a B2B e-commerce application (Ultra Premium Direct's professional store) targeting the French market. It extends a base e-commerce configuration and defines runtime settings including API endpoints, feature flags (tax-exclusive pricing, samples, address comments, cart rules), and locale settings for French (fr-FR). The configuration specifically customizes the B2B storefront with disabled consumer features (animals, subscriptions, user guides) and B2B-specific functionality like editable cart quantities and address comments.
