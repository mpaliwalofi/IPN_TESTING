**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce-b2b\server\routes\health.ts`

## Summary
This code defines a health check endpoint for the B2B e-commerce application's server. It returns a simple "OK" response, which is typically used by monitoring tools, load balancers, or orchestration systems to verify that the server is running and responsive. This is a standard practice for ensuring application availability and enabling automated health monitoring in production environments.
