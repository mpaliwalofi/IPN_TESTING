# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce-b2b\server\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for the server-side code of a B2B e-commerce front-end application. It extends the base TypeScript configuration from the Nuxt.js build directory, ensuring that server-specific TypeScript compilation settings are inherited from the main Nuxt framework configuration. This allows the server code to be type-checked and compiled consistently with the Nuxt.js project's TypeScript standards.
