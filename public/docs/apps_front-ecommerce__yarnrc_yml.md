# .yarnrc.yml

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\.yarnrc.yml`

## Summary
This is a Yarn package manager configuration file that specifies the node linker strategy. It configures Yarn to use the traditional `node-modules` approach for dependency installation, rather than Yarn's newer Plug'n'Play (PnP) mode, ensuring compatibility with tools and workflows that expect a standard `node_modules` directory structure.
