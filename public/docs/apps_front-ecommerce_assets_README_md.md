**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\assets\README.md`

## Summary
This is a README file documenting the `assets` directory in a Nuxt.js e-commerce front-end application. The directory is intended to store un-compiled static assets like LESS, SASS, or JavaScript files that will be processed by Webpack during the build process. It's an optional directory that provides a structured location for pre-processed styling and scripting resources in the Nuxt.js framework.
