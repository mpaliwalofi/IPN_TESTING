**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\commitlint.config.js`

## Summary
This is a Commitlint configuration file that enforces conventional commit message standards for the front-ecommerce application. It extends the standard conventional commits ruleset and defines allowed commit type prefixes (feat, fix, docs, chore, etc.) that developers must use when making Git commits, ensuring consistent and meaningful commit history across the project.
