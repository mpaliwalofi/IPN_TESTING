# AnimalHeader.spec.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\animal\__tests__\AnimalHeader.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a unit test file for the `AnimalHeader` Vue component in an e-commerce application. It sets up a basic test suite that mounts the component with mock animal data as props and verifies that the component can be successfully instantiated and rendered. The test currently only validates the component's existence, serving as a foundation for more comprehensive testing of the animal header display functionality.
