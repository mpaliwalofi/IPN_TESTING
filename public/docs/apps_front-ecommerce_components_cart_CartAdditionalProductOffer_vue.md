## Summary
This Vue component displays an additional product offer (cross-sell) in the shopping cart, featuring promotional upsell items that can be added to the customer's purchase. It renders promotional tags with different layouts for mobile and desktop views, and displays the base price of the offered product variant, conditionally showing content only when valid Strapi data exists for the cross-sell item.
