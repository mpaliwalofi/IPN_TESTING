## Summary
This Storybook configuration file defines visual documentation and interactive examples for the `CartPromoTag` Vue component used in an e-commerce shopping cart. It showcases two variants: a basic promotional tag displaying discount information (like "Flash Sale -5.97 €") and a copyable version that includes a promo code that users can copy. The stories demonstrate how the component handles markdown-formatted promotional content with optional code copying functionality for cart-related promotional offers.
