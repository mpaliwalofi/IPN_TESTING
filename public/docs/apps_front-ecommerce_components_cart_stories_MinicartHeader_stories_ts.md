## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file that defines visual test stories for the `MiniCartHeader` Vue component in an e-commerce application. It creates two story variants: a "Default" story showing the header when a specific amount remains until free shipping eligibility ($14.10), and a "FreeShipping" story displaying the header when the free shipping threshold has been met (amount = 0). The stories enable isolated testing and documentation of the mini cart header's behavior in different shipping cost scenarios.
