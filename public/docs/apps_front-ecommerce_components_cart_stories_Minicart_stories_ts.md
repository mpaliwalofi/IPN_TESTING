## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file that defines visual component stories for the MiniCart component in an e-commerce application. It exports a single "Default" story that demonstrates the MiniCart component in its open state (`displayMiniCart: true`) with mock show/hide callback functions, wrapped in a Suspense boundary for async loading states. The story enables developers and designers to preview and test the mini shopping cart UI component in isolation.
