## Summary
This Vue component implements the payment step in a checkout funnel for an e-commerce application. It displays available payment methods for users to select during checkout, handles payment method submission, and shows a special state when payment is skipped (for free orders). The component manages bidirectional data flow with its parent through computed properties and emits, coordinating payment method selection, form configuration, and loading states while presenting a secure payment interface with localized messaging.
