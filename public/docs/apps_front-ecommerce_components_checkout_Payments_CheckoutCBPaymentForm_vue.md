# CheckoutCBPaymentForm.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\checkout\Payments\CheckoutCBPaymentForm.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component implements a payment form specifically for Checkout.com (CB) payment processing in an e-commerce checkout flow. It dynamically loads the Checkout.com Frames SDK, initializes a secure card tokenization form with validation, and manages the payment submission workflow by emitting events when the form is ready, submitting, or cancelled. The component handles card validation in real-time and tokenizes card details for PCI-compliant payment processing without directly handling sensitive card data.

## Function Details

### `loadHead`


### `submit`
