## Summary
This Vue component implements PayPal payment integration for an e-commerce checkout flow. It dynamically loads the PayPal SDK script, renders PayPal payment buttons, and manages the payment submission lifecycle by emitting events ('ready', 'submitting', 'cancel') to coordinate with the parent checkout process. The component accepts payment offer details and PayPal-specific configuration (including client ID) as props to initialize the payment interface.
