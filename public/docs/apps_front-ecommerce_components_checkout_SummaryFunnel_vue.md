## Summary
This Vue component renders the order summary sidebar for a checkout funnel in an e-commerce application. It displays a collapsible list of cart items with product details, images, and quantities, while maintaining synchronization with the parent checkout state through two-way binding. The component automatically expands pickup point options when multiple shipping methods are available and provides localized labels for product counts and summary information.
