**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\AccountLinks.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders a section of account-related navigation links for an e-commerce dashboard. It accepts content and account link configuration props, then displays them as a responsive grid/flexbox layout of clickable CTAs (call-to-action buttons) using the `SASOption` component, allowing users to navigate to different dashboard sections.
