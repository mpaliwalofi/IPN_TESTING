**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\AnimalsList.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component displays a list of animals in an e-commerce context, specifically for a user's account section. It receives animal data and content configuration as props, then renders them using a CarouselAnimal component with carousel functionality disabled (no-carousel, force-carousel flags), showing a title and subtitle that indicate the number of animals the user has.
