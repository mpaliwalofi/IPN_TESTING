## Summary
This Vue component serves as a content block wrapper for integrating Booxi appointment booking functionality into the e-commerce front-end. It accepts CMS content configuration along with a label parameter and renders a Booxi booking widget using the API key stored in the page's content data. The component acts as a bridge between the CMS content management system and the third-party Booxi booking service.
