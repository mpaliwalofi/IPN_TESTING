# CategoryCard.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\CategoryCard.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders a clickable category card for an e-commerce storefront that displays a category name and its starting price. It tracks hover state and emits events to parent components when hovered, with responsive behavior that shows different text and an arrow icon on desktop viewports versus mobile. The component uses internationalization for price formatting and includes special client-side rendering logic to handle the desktop/mobile display differences.
