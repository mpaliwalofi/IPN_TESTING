**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\CrossSellMainProduct.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component displays a cross-sell product recommendation alongside a background image, typically used on product detail pages. It fetches product metadata based on a SKU prop and integrates with analytics tracking by computing a source item list identifier for cross-sell recommendations. The component supports configurable placement direction and renders a product card overlaid on an optional background image, with responsive behavior that hides the background on mobile devices.
