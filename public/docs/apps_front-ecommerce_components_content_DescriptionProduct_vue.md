# DescriptionProduct.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\DescriptionProduct.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component displays product descriptions in an e-commerce application, conditionally rendering either a short description (on mobile) or full description (on desktop) based on viewport size. It receives product metadata and an enabled flag as props, then uses Markdown components to render the appropriate description content with responsive visibility classes, only showing the section when enabled and description content exists.
