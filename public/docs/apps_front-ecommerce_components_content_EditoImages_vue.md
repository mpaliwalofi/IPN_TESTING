# EditoImages.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\EditoImages.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders editorial images for an e-commerce storefront, supporting both single image display and multi-image carousel presentations. It handles responsive image sizing across different breakpoints (sm, lg, xl), lazy loading, optional overlays, and clickable links to content pages. The component uses a fallback mechanism for server-side rendering and dynamically switches between a single SmartImage display or a Carousel component based on the number of images provided.
