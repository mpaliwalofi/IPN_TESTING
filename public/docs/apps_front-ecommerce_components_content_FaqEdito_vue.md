# FaqEdito.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\FaqEdito.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders a two-column FAQ editorial section for an e-commerce storefront, displaying an image with optional overlay on one side and a list of FAQ questions on the other. The layout is responsive with configurable text/image positioning (left/right on desktop, customizable order on mobile) and uses CMS data from Strapi to populate both the image and FAQ questions dynamically.
