## Summary
This Vue component renders an FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) section for an e-commerce storefront. It displays a configurable title heading and a list of questions/answers, both sourced from Strapi CMS content with customizable heading levels. The component uses a responsive grid layout (12-column on large screens) and only renders elements when the corresponding data exists.
