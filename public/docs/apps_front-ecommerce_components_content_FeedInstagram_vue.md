# FeedInstagram.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\FeedInstagram.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component displays an Instagram feed section for an e-commerce storefront, showing up to 5 Instagram images from a CMS-managed feed. It filters and transforms Instagram feed data from the CMS into a standardized image format, then renders them in a responsive grid layout with a title, subtitle, and hashtag reference, all wrapped in a clickable link to the Instagram profile.
