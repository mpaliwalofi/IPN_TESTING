**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\GuideEntrance.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component provides a flexible entrance/navigation element for user guides in an e-commerce application. It conditionally renders either a `Jumbotron` component or a styled `Entrance` button/link based on the `isButton` prop, with the button variant linking to a user guide page and displaying localized title/subtitle text. The component serves as a reusable CMS content block for guiding users to help documentation from various parts of the application (particularly product category listing filters).
