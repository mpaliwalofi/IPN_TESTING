**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\HeroCoverSubscription.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders a hero section specifically designed for subscription-related pages in an e-commerce application. It displays a customizable cover area with a tertiary background that includes a heading, SEO text, optional call-to-action buttons, and a USP (Unique Selling Points) grid, all styled with white text for contrast. The component is CMS-driven, accepting content parameters from Strapi to control the layout and content of the hero section, making it reusable across different subscription landing pages.
