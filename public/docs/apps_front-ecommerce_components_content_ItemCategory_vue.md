## Summary
This Vue component renders a clickable category card for an e-commerce catalog, displaying a category image and navigation link. It accepts category data from Algolia search (including slug and image), supports both row and column layout modes via props, and generates localized URLs to navigate to the category detail page. The component uses responsive sizing with different image dimensions across breakpoints and shows a "see category" button overlay on hover for desktop views.
