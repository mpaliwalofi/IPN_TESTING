# Jumbotron.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\Jumbotron.vue`

## Summary
This Vue 3 component renders a responsive jumbotron/hero banner for an e-commerce storefront, displaying large promotional images with optional overlays. It conditionally shows different images for mobile and desktop viewports (or falls back to desktop-only), using the SmartImage component with specific size configurations and transformations to optimize image delivery across different breakpoints (500px height for mobile, 600px for desktop).
