# OrderAgainAccount.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\OrderAgainAccount.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component displays a customer's last order with an option to reorder it on their account page. It conditionally renders an order summary card and a "Order Again" action button (if the order is not a subscription), using data from the CMS configuration and the user's order history. The component is part of an e-commerce front-end that allows customers to quickly repurchase items from their previous orders.
