## Summary
This Vue component displays a summary card for a single order in an e-commerce account section. It shows the most expensive item's image, order date, and current status (with visual state indicators for cancelled/error/shipping/payment states), providing users a quick overview of their order with responsive formatting that adapts based on screen size (mobile vs desktop).
