**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\Podcast.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders a podcast player by embedding an iframe provided through its props. It accepts content data conforming to the `IContent` interface along with an `iframe` parameter, and displays the iframe HTML in a centered, responsive section using Tailwind CSS classes. The component serves as a reusable content block for displaying podcast embeds (likely from platforms like Spotify, Apple Podcasts, etc.) within the e-commerce front-end's CMS-driven content system.
