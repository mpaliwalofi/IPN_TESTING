# ShopRelations.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\ShopRelations.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component displays a horizontal scrollable list of related shops for an e-commerce platform. It renders shop images as clickable links that navigate to individual shop pages, with an optional section title and responsive sizing that adapts from mobile (scrollable) to desktop (centered) layouts. The component uses smart image optimization and localized routing to create a shop discovery/navigation feature.
