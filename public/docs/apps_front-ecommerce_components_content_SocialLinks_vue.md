# SocialLinks.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\SocialLinks.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders a list of social media links/icons for an e-commerce site, supporting two data sources: either explicit `links` passed as props (from a CMS) or fallback internationalized links from translation files. The component provides flexible layout options (standard flex or grid layout) and uses SmartLink components to create externally-opening links with appropriate accessibility attributes and custom icon classes.
