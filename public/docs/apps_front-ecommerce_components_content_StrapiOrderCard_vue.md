**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\StrapiOrderCard.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component serves as a wrapper for displaying order information in an e-commerce CMS system. It accepts both Strapi CMS content properties and order data, then renders an OrderCard component within a responsive grid layout with consistent spacing and styling, including a horizontal divider at the bottom for visual separation.
