## Summary
This Vue component manages the display and editing of subscription details in an e-commerce application. It handles toggling between two edit modes (calendar view for draft subscriptions and interval editing for active subscriptions) based on the active tab, and automatically scrolls to the appropriate section when entering/exiting edit mode. The component serves as a container for subscription card information with collapsible sections and emits events for urgent dispatches and successful subscription updates.
