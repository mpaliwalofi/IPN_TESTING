# AccountCards.spec.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\__tests__\AccountCards.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a unit test file for the `AccountCards.vue` component in an e-commerce front-end application. It verifies that the component can be successfully mounted with mocked account card data, stubbing out child components (`SubscriptionCard`, `OrderCard`, `GuideEntrance`) to isolate the component's mounting behavior and ensure proper integration of account-related display elements.
