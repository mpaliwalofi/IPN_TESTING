## Summary
This is a placeholder test file for the AccountLinks component in an e-commerce front-end application. The test suite is currently skipped (empty) and serves as a structural placeholder for future unit tests that would verify the functionality of account-related navigation links, such as login, profile, or order history links typically found in e-commerce user interfaces.
