# CarouselAnimal.spec.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\__tests__\CarouselAnimal.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a test specification file for the `CarouselAnimal` Vue component in an e-commerce application. It contains unit tests that verify the component mounts correctly under three different data scenarios: with multiple animals (default carousel behavior), with a single animal, and with an empty animal list. The tests use Vitest and Vue Test Utils to validate the component's rendering behavior with different props (`noCarousel`, `noReturn`, `addAnimal`) and mocked animal data states.
