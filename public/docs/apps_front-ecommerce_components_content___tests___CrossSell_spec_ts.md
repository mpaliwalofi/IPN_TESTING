**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\__tests__\CrossSell.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a **commented-out test file** for a CrossSell Vue component in an e-commerce application. The skeletal test structure was set up to verify basic mounting functionality of a cross-sell products feature (products recommended alongside the main product), but the tests are currently disabled and not actively running.
