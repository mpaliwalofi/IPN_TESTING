## Summary
This is a unit test file for the `DoubleEdito.vue` component in an e-commerce front-end application. It verifies that the component mounts correctly with and without props, and validates that the `editos` property is properly passed through the `params` prop. The tests ensure the component's basic rendering functionality and prop handling work as expected using Vue Test Utils.
