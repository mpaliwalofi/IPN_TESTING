# EditoImage.spec.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\__tests__\EditoImage.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a unit test file for the `EditoImages.vue` component in an e-commerce front-end application. It verifies that the component correctly renders varying numbers of editorial images (one, two, or three) by checking that the appropriate number of `&lt;picture&gt;` elements are generated based on the `images` prop passed to the component. The tests also ensure the component can mount gracefully both with and without image data props.
