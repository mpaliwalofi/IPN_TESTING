# FAQQuestions.spec.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\__tests__\FAQQuestions.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a unit test file for the FAQQuestions Vue component in an e-commerce application. It verifies that the component mounts correctly with FAQ data and tests the `selectQuestion` method, which toggles accordion-style question expansion and updates the URL hash with the question identifier (enabling deep-linking to specific FAQ items).
