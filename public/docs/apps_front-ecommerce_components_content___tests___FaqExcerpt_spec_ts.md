# FaqExcerpt.spec.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\__tests__\FaqExcerpt.spec.ts`

## Summary
This test file validates the `FaqExcerpt.vue` component, which displays a frequently asked questions excerpt section in an e-commerce application. The tests verify that the component mounts correctly with mock FAQ data, conditionally renders the title heading (h2) only when a title prop is provided, and properly handles the questions data structure through props validation.
