# FeedInstagram.spec.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\__tests__\FeedInstagram.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a unit test file for the `FeedInstagram` Vue component that displays Instagram feed content in an e-commerce application. The tests verify the component mounts successfully under various scenarios: with default Instagram feed data, without images, without image attributes, and with empty props, ensuring the component handles different data states gracefully. The test suite validates that the component's `params` prop correctly receives Instagram feed data and that the component remains stable across edge cases.
