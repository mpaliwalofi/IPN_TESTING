# ItemBlogGrid.spec.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\__tests__\ItemBlogGrid.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a unit test file for the `ItemBlogGrid` Vue component in an e-commerce application. It verifies the component mounts correctly, handles conditional rendering when the `gridTitle` prop is undefined (ensuring the title element is not rendered), and validates the component's output against a snapshot to detect unintended UI changes. The tests focus on ensuring the blog grid displays properly with and without a title, which appears to showcase practical blog articles related to product content.
