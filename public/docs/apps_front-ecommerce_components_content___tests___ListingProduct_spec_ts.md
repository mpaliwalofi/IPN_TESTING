# ListingProduct.spec.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\__tests__\ListingProduct.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a unit test file for the `ListingProduct.vue` component, which displays a list of product cards in an e-commerce application. The tests verify that the component correctly renders multiple product cards from product metadata, mounts successfully, and emits a 'selected' event when a product card is clicked, enabling product selection functionality in the catalog listing interface.
