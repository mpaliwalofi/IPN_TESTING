## Summary
This is a Vue component test suite for the `MainProduct` component in an e-commerce application. It verifies that the component correctly mounts with product and cross-sell data, emits `selected` events when users click on product images or call-to-action buttons, and gracefully handles missing optional data like product images and review ratings.
