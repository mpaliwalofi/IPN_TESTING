# Shipup.spec.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\__tests__\Shipup.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a unit test file for the Shipup Vue component, which appears to handle order shipment tracking functionality in an e-commerce application. The test suite validates basic component mounting and prop initialization (order and params), ensuring the component can be instantiated correctly with undefined props as a baseline test case.
