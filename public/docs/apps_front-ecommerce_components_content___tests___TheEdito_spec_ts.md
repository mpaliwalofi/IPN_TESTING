## Summary
This is a Vue component test suite for an "Edito" (editorial content) component in an e-commerce front-end application. The tests verify that the component correctly mounts and validates its props across multiple configurations, including variations with different numbers of images (0-3), background settings, text positioning (textRight), mobile layouts (mobileImageFirst), and CTA button configurations. The suite uses mock data to test different editorial content layouts and ensures the component behaves correctly with various combinations of images, markdown content, headings, and call-to-action buttons.
