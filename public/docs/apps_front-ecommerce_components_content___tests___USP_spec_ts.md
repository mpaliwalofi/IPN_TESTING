**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\content\__tests__\USP.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a Vue component test suite for a USP (Unique Selling Proposition) component in an e-commerce front-end application. The tests verify that the USP component correctly mounts and conditionally renders two child components (USPLarge and TheEdito) based on the presence of their respective configuration props, ensuring the component handles scenarios where either or both sub-components may be present or absent.
