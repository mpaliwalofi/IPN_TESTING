## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file that defines visual test stories for the `AccordionToTab` Vue component in an e-commerce application. The component provides a responsive UI pattern that displays content as accordion items on mobile devices and switches to a tabbed interface on larger screens. The stories demonstrate different configurations including a default state with three categories and a variation where the first accordion is pre-opened on mobile viewports, with Chromatic visual regression testing configured across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints.
