## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file that defines visual test stories for the CartCrossSell e-commerce component. It sets up the component to be tested and documented across three viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Chromatic for visual regression testing. The Default story renders the CartCrossSell component with Vue 3's Suspense wrapper to handle async loading states, enabling developers and designers to preview and test cross-sell product recommendations that appear in the shopping cart.
