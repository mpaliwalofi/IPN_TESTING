## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file for the `ListingProductCategory` component in an e-commerce application. It sets up visual testing scenarios with responsive viewport modes (mobile, tablet, desktop) and provides mock data for product category listings, including category push items with images/URLs and filter groups (like age filters for pet products). The file enables developers and designers to preview and test how the product category listing component renders across different screen sizes with sample e-commerce data.
