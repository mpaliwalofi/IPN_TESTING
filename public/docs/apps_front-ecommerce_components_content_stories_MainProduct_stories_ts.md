## Summary
This Storybook configuration file defines visual documentation and test cases for the `MainProduct` component in an e-commerce application. It sets up stories that showcase the component's cross-sell product recommendations feature with different viewport sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop) and variations including a default state with a title ("Vous aimerez aussi") and a no-title variant. The stories use mock catalog data to demonstrate how related products are displayed alongside a main product (ID '003001') for testing and design review purposes.

## Type Aliases
