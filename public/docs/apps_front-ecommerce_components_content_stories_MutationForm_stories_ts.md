## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file that defines visual documentation and testing scenarios for the `MutationForm` Vue component used in an e-commerce application. The file exports a story with sample data for a contact form that includes various input types (select, email, text, textarea, file uploads) configured for customer support interactions, allowing users to identify themselves (individual, subscriber, breeder, etc.), provide contact details, reference orders, and submit messages with attachments. This enables developers and designers to preview and test the form component in isolation with realistic French-language content.
