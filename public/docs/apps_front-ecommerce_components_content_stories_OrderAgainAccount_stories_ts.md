## Summary
This Storybook configuration file defines visual testing stories for the `OrderAgainAccount` Vue component in an e-commerce application. It sets up responsive viewport testing (mobile, tablet, desktop) using Chromatic and provides mock data for displaying a customer's last order information, including order details, pricing, and pickup point information with schedules. The stories enable developers and designers to preview and test how the "order again" feature appears across different screen sizes in the account section.
