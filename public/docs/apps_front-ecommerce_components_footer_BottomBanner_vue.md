# BottomBanner.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\footer\BottomBanner.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component implements a responsive bottom banner for marketing campaigns in an e-commerce application. It listens to custom Nuxt hooks to dynamically display/hide promotional banners with configurable content (text, images, CTAs) that adapts between mobile and desktop breakpoints. The component integrates with a tracking system (Pixie) to report campaign impressions and handles banner visibility state through application-level hooks for showing and resetting the banner content.
