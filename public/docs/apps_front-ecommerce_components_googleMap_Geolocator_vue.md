## Summary
This Vue component provides a geolocation-enabled address search interface for e-commerce checkout flows. It combines manual address input via a text field with automatic geolocation functionality through a "Find Me" button, using Google Maps services to help users quickly identify their location for delivery or pickup point selection. The component manages loading states and disabled states across both input methods while synchronizing the selected location data through v-model bindings.
