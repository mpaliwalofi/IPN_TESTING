# GoogleMapDisplayType.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\googleMap\GoogleMapDisplayType.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component provides a mobile-only toggle interface for switching between list and map display modes in a Google Maps feature. It renders two buttons that allow users to toggle between viewing location data as a list or on a map, with the active view being controlled through a v-model binding and visual styling applied based on the selected state and disabled prop.
