# GoogleMapListing.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\googleMap\GoogleMapListing.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders a scrollable list of clickable location markers for a Google Maps integration in an e-commerce application. It manages marker selection through v-model binding, automatically scrolling to the selected marker on desktop screens (≥1024px), and resets the scroll position when the places list updates with more than 3 items. The component displays each marker as a selectable button with radio-style UI, allowing users to pick a physical location (likely a store or pickup point) from the map's markers.
