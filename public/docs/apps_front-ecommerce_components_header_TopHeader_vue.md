# TopHeader.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\header\TopHeader.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component manages a dynamic top header banner for an e-commerce site that displays marketing content based on device breakpoints (mobile vs desktop). It listens to custom application hooks to show/hide the banner and render either text or image content with different configurations for mobile and desktop views, while also tracking user clicks on the banner links. The component integrates with a marketing/tracking system (Pixie) to receive campaign configurations and report user interactions.
