## Summary
This component implements a language/region switcher modal dialog for an e-commerce application. It displays a form that allows users to select their preferred country/language, featuring a split layout with a decorative image on one side and the language selection form (powered by `useLanguage` composable) on the other. The component accepts a default country prop and emits a close dialog event, providing a user-friendly way to handle locale preferences at key points in the user journey.
