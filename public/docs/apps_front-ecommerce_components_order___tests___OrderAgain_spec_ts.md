**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\order\__tests__\OrderAgain.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a test suite for the `OrderAgain` Vue component in an e-commerce application, which likely provides functionality for customers to quickly reorder items from their previous orders. The tests verify that the component mounts correctly with required props (`lastOrder` and `params`), validates prop values and their defaults (including flags like `flipped`, `inline`, `icon`, and `active`), and confirms that clicking a subscription/flip button toggles the `flipped` state, suggesting the component may have a flip animation or view-switching behavior for order resubmission.
