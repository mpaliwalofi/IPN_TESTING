## Summary
This is a Vue component test file that validates the `OrderInfoBillingAddressDisplay` component, which is responsible for displaying billing address information for orders in an e-commerce application. The test suite verifies that the component mounts correctly and properly receives billing address data as a prop, using mocked subscription data to simulate real billing address information.
