## Summary
This is a Vue component test suite for `OrderInfoFrequencyEdit`, which allows users to modify subscription delivery frequencies in an e-commerce application. The tests verify that the component mounts correctly with subscription props, renders an update frequency CTA button, and properly emits an `updateSubscriptionSuccess` event when the form is submitted to change a subscription's frequency settings.
