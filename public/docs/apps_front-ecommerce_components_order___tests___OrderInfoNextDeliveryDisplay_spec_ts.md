## Summary
This is a test suite for the `OrderInfoNextDeliveryDisplay` component in an e-commerce application, which displays information about a subscription's next scheduled delivery. The tests verify that the component mounts correctly with subscription and draft order data as props, validates the edit mode state, and ensures the "deliver now" call-to-action button properly triggers the delivery scheduling handler when clicked.
