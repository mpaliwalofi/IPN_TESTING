## Summary
This is a test file for the `OrderInfoShippingAddressDisplay` Vue component, which displays shipping address information for orders and subscriptions in an e-commerce application. The tests verify that the component mounts correctly, accepts props for subscription data, order data, loading states, and address switching functionality, and validates that users can toggle between displaying the order's shipping address versus the subscription's shipping address through a clickable switch control.
