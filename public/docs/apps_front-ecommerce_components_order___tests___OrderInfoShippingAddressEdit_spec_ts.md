## Summary
This is a test suite for the `OrderInfoShippingAddressEdit` Vue component, which allows users to edit shipping address information for both subscription and draft orders in an e-commerce application. The tests verify that the component mounts correctly with required props (subscription, order, edit mode, delivery, and address display settings) and validate that two key methods (`saveShippingMethodSubscription` and `saveShippingMethodDraft`) are properly triggered when users click the corresponding save buttons in the shipping address modal.
