## Summary
This is a unit test file for the `OrderInfoProductsList` Vue component in an e-commerce application. It verifies that the component correctly mounts and receives props related to displaying order items, including regular items, free items, subscription status, and editability flags. The tests use Vue Test Utils with shallow mounting to validate the component's basic functionality and prop handling for order information display.
