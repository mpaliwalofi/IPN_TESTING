## Summary
This is a unit test file for the `OrderInfos` Vue component in an e-commerce front-end application. It tests the component's mounting behavior and its edit mode functionality, specifically verifying that the component can toggle between display and edit modes when a CTA button is clicked. The tests use shallow mounting with slot content to ensure the component properly handles both default display content and editable content scenarios.
