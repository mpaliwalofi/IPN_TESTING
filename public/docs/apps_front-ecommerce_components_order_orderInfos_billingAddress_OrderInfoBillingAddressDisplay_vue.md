**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\order\orderInfos\billingAddress\OrderInfoBillingAddressDisplay.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component displays billing address information in an e-commerce order context. It compares the billing address with the shipping address (if provided) to show a visual indicator when they are identical, then renders the billing address details including company, street, postal code, and city. The component uses data masking attributes (`data-cs-mask`) for privacy/security purposes on sensitive address fields.
