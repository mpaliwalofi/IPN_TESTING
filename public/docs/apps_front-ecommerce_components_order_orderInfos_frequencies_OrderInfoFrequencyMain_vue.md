**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\order\orderInfos\frequencies\OrderInfoFrequencyMain.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component manages the display and editing of subscription frequency information in an e-commerce order context. It shows the current subscription interval and, when the subscription is editable, provides an inline editing interface that triggers a reload of the frequency section upon successful updates. The component acts as a container that coordinates between display mode and edit mode for subscription frequency settings.
