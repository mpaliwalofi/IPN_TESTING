## Summary
This Vue component displays payment method information for both orders and subscriptions in an e-commerce application. It determines the appropriate payment status by checking various states (awaiting payment, error, cancelled, shipped) and identifies the payment method type (bank transfer, check, PayPal, or manual payment). The component uses composables to assess order and subscription states and renders payment-related information with loading states, serving as a display-only view for payment details in order/subscription management interfaces.
