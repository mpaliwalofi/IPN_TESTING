# OrderInfoPromotionsDisplay.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\order\orderInfos\promotions\OrderInfoPromotionsDisplay.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component displays promotional discounts applied to an order in an e-commerce application. It conditionally renders a list of active promotions from the order's `promotionsSummary`, showing each promotion's name and discount amount (or "gift" label for zero-value promotions), formatted using a price utility function. The component is designed to integrate into a larger order information display section, typically shown during checkout or order review.
