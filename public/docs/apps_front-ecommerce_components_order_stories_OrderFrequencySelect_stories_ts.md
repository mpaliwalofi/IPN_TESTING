## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file that defines UI documentation and interactive examples for the `OrderFrequencySelect` Vue component used in an e-commerce application. It creates two stories: a "Default" story showing the component with no preselected value, and a "Preselection" story demonstrating the component with a pre-populated frequency selection (via API endpoint reference), allowing developers and designers to visualize how customers can select order frequency options during the checkout or subscription process.

## Type Aliases
