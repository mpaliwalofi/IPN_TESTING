## Summary
This Storybook configuration file defines visual documentation and test cases for the `OrderInfoFrequencyEdit` component in an e-commerce application. It showcases two states of the component: a default state with subscription data and a loading state, allowing developers to preview and test how users can edit subscription frequency settings for orders. The stories use mock subscription data to demonstrate the component's behavior in isolation from the full application.
