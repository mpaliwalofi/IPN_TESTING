## Summary
This Storybook configuration file defines visual documentation and testing scenarios for the `OrderInfoExclusiveProductUpsellsList` component in an e-commerce application. It creates two stories ("Default" and "ManyUpsells") that demonstrate how the component renders exclusive product upsell offers during the order process, with mock data showing product variants with pricing, discounts, and multilingual translations. The stories allow developers and designers to preview and test the upsell list component in isolation with different quantities of upsell products.
