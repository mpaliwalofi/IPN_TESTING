## Summary
This Storybook configuration file defines visual documentation and testing scenarios for an `OrderInfoExclusiveUpsell` component in an e-commerce application. It sets up sample data including product information (dog food product with SKU '001008'), variant details (4kg size), and pricing information to demonstrate how exclusive upsell offers are displayed during the order process. The story provides mock data from both Strapi CMS (product content/images) and Sylius e-commerce platform (inventory/pricing) to render the upsell component in isolation for development and testing purposes.
