# OrderSummaryDetailsTotalPrice.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\order\summary\OrderSummaryDetailsTotalPrice.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component displays the total price summary section for an order, cart, or subscription in an e-commerce application. It shows the total amount including tax with appropriate labels, and conditionally displays "VAT included" text and adjusts font sizing based on whether the pricing feature is configured to show tax-inclusive (TTC) prices. The component uses internationalization for labels and a custom price formatting composable to display monetary values.
