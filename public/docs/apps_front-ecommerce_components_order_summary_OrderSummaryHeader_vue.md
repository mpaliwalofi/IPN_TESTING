## Summary
This Vue component displays a progress bar header for the order summary that shows customers how much more they need to spend to qualify for free shipping. It calculates the progression percentage based on the cart's current amount and the minimum order threshold, displaying the remaining amount needed and a visual progress bar that adjusts its color based on whether it's for a regular cart (primary color) or subscription order (tertiary color).
