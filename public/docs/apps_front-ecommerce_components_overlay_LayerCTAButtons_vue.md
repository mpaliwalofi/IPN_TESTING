# LayerCTAButtons.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\overlay\LayerCTAButtons.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders Call-to-Action (CTA) button overlays for an e-commerce application, with responsive support for both desktop and mobile layouts. It displays configurable buttons from Strapi CMS data that can have different styles (outline, ghost), colors (primary, secondary, tertiary, neutral), and link properties (URL, target, icons). The component uses ClientOnly rendering with a fallback template and horizontal scrolling on mobile to accommodate multiple buttons within viewport constraints.
