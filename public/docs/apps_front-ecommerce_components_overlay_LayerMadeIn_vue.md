# LayerMadeIn.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\overlay\LayerMadeIn.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders a "Made In" overlay layer for an e-commerce product display, with separate configurations for desktop and mobile viewports. It displays an optional icon image alongside descriptive text, using responsive Tailwind classes to show/hide the appropriate version based on screen size, with the mobile version also serving as a server-side rendering fallback through `ClientOnly`.
