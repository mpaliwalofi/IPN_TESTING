# LayerMarkdown.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\overlay\LayerMarkdown.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders markdown content as an overlay layer with responsive behavior for both desktop and mobile views. It accepts separate markdown layer configurations for desktop and mobile, applying dynamic font families (including a custom 'cedrat' font) and font sizes ranging from 2xs to 31xl using Tailwind CSS classes. The component uses server-side rendering with ClientOnly wrapper and renders markdown with configurable heading levels (defaulting to H2) while supporting flexible positioning through flexbox alignment.
