## Summary
This Vue component displays product composition and material information in an expandable accordion format for an e-commerce product detail page. It renders a collapsible section that shows composition details (like materials, constituents, and nutritional information) from the product metadata, with support for multiple composition information tables. The component uses internationalization for labels and includes accessibility features like screen reader text and proper ARIA semantics through the AccordionFold wrapper.
