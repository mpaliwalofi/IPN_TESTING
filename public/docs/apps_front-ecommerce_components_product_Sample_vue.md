**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\product\Sample.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component displays a product sample with an add-to-cart interface for an e-commerce application. It renders the sample's image, allows users to select a quantity (between 1-2 units) using a counter control, and provides an "Add to Cart" button that emits the selected sample and quantity to the parent component. The component handles loading states during cart operations and formats the quantity display as currency notation.
