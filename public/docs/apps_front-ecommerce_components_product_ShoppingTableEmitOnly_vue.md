# ShoppingTableEmitOnly.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\product\ShoppingTableEmitOnly.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component provides a shopping table interface for e-commerce product variants that emits events rather than handling cart operations directly. It displays product format options, pricing, and quantity selectors in a tabular layout, delegating the actual "add to cart" functionality to parent components through event emissions. The component integrates with both Strapi product data and Sylius e-commerce system, supporting features like subscription products and stock availability checks.
