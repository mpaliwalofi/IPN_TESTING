## Summary
This Vue component provides a shopping cart row interface for adding product variants to the cart in an e-commerce application. It manages product quantity selection, validates stock availability, handles loading states, and emits cart-related events (add to cart, quantity updates, errors) to parent components without rendering the full table row UI itself. The component integrates with both Sylius (e-commerce platform) and Strapi (CMS) data sources, supports subscription options, and includes tracking functionality for analytics purposes.
