## Summary
This Vue component renders a table row displaying pricing information for a product variant in an e-commerce shopping interface. It handles both tax-free (HT) and tax-inclusive pricing display modes based on feature configuration, showing the main price and detailed unit pricing (e.g., price per kg/liter) with values sourced from either Sylius or Strapi backend systems.
