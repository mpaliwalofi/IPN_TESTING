## Summary
This is a test suite for the `ReviewsProduct` Vue component that verifies product review display functionality in an e-commerce application. The tests ensure the component correctly handles pagination of product reviews, including expanding to show more reviews (incrementing by 4 each time), collapsing back to the initial 4 reviews, and automatically scrolling back to the top of the reviews section when the "display less" action is triggered.
