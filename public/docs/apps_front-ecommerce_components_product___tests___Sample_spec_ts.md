## Summary
This is a unit test file for a Vue component called `Sample.vue` that handles product sample functionality in an e-commerce application. The tests verify that the component can mount correctly, increment sample quantities (from 1 to 2), and trigger the add-to-cart functionality for product samples, using mock Strapi product data including sample ("echantillons") information.
