**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\product\__tests__\ShoppingPanel.spec.ts`

## Summary
This test file validates the `ShoppingPanel` component, which handles the product ordering interface in an e-commerce application. It tests the component's default state (regular purchase vs subscription mode, quantity selection, variant selection), verifies proper initialization with Strapi and Sylius product data, and ensures cart store integration works correctly. The tests cover both catalog display functionality and user interaction workflows for adding products to cart with different purchasing options.
