## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file that defines interactive documentation stories for a `RationCalculator` Vue component used in an e-commerce application. The stories showcase the calculator component in two scenarios: one for adult dogs ("chien") and another for puppies ("chiot"), demonstrating how pet food ration calculations vary based on product reference and animal type. This enables developers and designers to visualize and test the ration calculator's behavior in isolation for different pet food products.
