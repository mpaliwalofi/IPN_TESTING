## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file that defines visual documentation and testing stories for a product sample component in an e-commerce application. It creates a "Default" story that renders the `Sample.vue` component with mock Strapi product data, specifically displaying the first product sample (echantillon) in a responsive container layout. The story enables developers and designers to preview and test how individual product samples appear in isolation within the e-commerce interface.
