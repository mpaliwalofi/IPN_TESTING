# AddressForm.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\shared\AddressForm.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component provides a modal form for creating or editing customer shipping/billing addresses in an e-commerce application. It accepts an optional existing address for editing, handles form submission through a configurable `addressPersister` callback, and manages the modal's open/close state while emitting events upon successful address save. The component integrates with address validation, country selection, and optional address comment features based on runtime configuration.
