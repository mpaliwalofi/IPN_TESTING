# AnimalCard.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\shared\AnimalCard.vue`

## Summary
This component displays a clickable card for an individual animal in an e-commerce pet store application. It renders the animal's photo (or a default dog/cat avatar icon if no photo exists) alongside the animal's name, with configurable carousel and non-carousel display modes that adjust sizing and layout. The component uses ImageKit for optimized image delivery and supports data masking for privacy compliance.
