**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\shared\Booxi.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component provides a booking widget integration for the e-commerce front-end by wrapping the Booxi booking system. It renders a button that triggers the Booxi booking widget when clicked, accepting an API key for authentication and an optional custom label (defaulting to a localized "Book Now" translation). The component only displays when a valid API key is provided, enabling customers to schedule appointments or bookings directly from the e-commerce interface.
