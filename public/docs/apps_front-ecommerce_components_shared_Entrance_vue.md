**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\shared\Entrance.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component serves as a reusable navigation entrance/link wrapper for an e-commerce storefront. It accepts a destination URL via the `to` prop and uses `SmartLinkContent` to create a clickable container with a flexible slot-based layout that can display optional before/after content plus a centered title and subtitle section, allowing for consistent styling of navigation elements throughout the application.
