# ProductCardSkeleton.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\shared\ProductCardSkeleton.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component displays a skeleton loading placeholder for a product card in an e-commerce application. It creates an animated pulsing effect with placeholder blocks that mimic the layout of an actual product card (image, title, description, price, and action button) while content is being loaded. The component accepts props to customize the layout style and background color of the skeleton elements, with responsive sizing across different breakpoints.
