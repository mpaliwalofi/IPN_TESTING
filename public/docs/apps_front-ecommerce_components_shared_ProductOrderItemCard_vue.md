# ProductOrderItemCard.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\shared\ProductOrderItemCard.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders a product card specifically for order items in an e-commerce context. It extends the base `ProductCard` component by adding a bottom section that displays order-specific details including the total price, quantity, and variant name when an `orderItem` is provided. The component is designed to show products within order contexts (like order history or cross-sell items) with pricing and quantity information formatted for display.
