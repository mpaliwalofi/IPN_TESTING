## Summary
This is a reusable Select dropdown component for an e-commerce application that provides a customizable selection interface with two-way data binding via v-model. It accepts an array of options with labels, handles disabled states, supports custom comparison logic for matching selected values, and emits update events when the selection changes. The component includes accessibility features (screen reader labels), styling variations (small/regular sizes, custom heights), and slot-based customization for labels and options.
