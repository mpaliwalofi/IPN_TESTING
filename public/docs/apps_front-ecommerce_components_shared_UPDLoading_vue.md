**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\shared\UPDLoading.vue`

## Summary
This Vue 3 component provides a reusable loading state wrapper with animated transitions for e-commerce content. It conditionally displays either a spinning SVG logo animation or slot content based on the `loading` prop, using Vue's transition-group to smoothly fade between states. The component offers flexibility through props to customize the wrapper element tag, control visibility timing, and adjust styling of the loading indicator.
