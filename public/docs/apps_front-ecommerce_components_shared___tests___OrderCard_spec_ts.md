## Summary
This is a test suite for the `OrderCard` Vue component in an e-commerce application. It validates that the component correctly renders and handles different order states, including normal orders, null/empty orders, and orders requiring alerts. The tests verify component mounting, prop validation, and the presence of key UI elements (header, content, alert) across various scenarios using Vue Test Utils.
