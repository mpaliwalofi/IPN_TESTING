**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\shared\__tests__\Stars.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a test specification file for a `Stars` Vue component used in an e-commerce application to display product ratings. The tests verify that the component correctly renders star icons (filled, half-filled, and outline) based on a numeric rating value prop, ensuring proper visual representation of ratings from 0 to 5 stars. The suite validates component mounting, prop validation (`value` and `color`), and the conditional rendering logic that displays the appropriate combination of star icon types for different rating values.
