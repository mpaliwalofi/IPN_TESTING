## Summary
This Storybook configuration file defines visual documentation and testing scenarios for the `FrequencyModal` component in an e-commerce application. It showcases three variants of a subscription frequency selection modal for pet food products (specifically dog food rations): a default state, one with a recommended frequency pre-selected, and one displayed from a product page context. The stories demonstrate how the modal handles subscription pricing, product quantities, and different entry points within the e-commerce flow.
