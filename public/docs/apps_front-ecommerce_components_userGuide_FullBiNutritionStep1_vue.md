**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\userGuide\FullBiNutritionStep1.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component implements the first step of a bi-nutrition user guide form for pet food recommendations, specifically initialized for cats. It collects essential pet information (name, gender, type, age, sterilization status, weight, body condition, and activity level) and validates form completion across required fields and conditional field groups before allowing users to proceed to the next step. The component integrates tracking analytics, manages form state through a custom FullBiNutritionStep1Form class, and dynamically enables/disables the submit button based on form completeness validation.
