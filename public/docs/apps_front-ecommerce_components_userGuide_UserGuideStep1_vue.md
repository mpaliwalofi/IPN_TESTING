## Summary
This Vue component implements the first step of an e-commerce user guide for adding pet information. It manages a form (UserGuideStep1Form) that collects essential pet details including name, gender, type (species), breed, and anniversary/birthdate, with dynamic validation to enable/disable the submit button. The component handles pet type changes by preserving only the name and anniversary fields while resetting breed/gender selections, and tracks user progression through the onboarding flow.
