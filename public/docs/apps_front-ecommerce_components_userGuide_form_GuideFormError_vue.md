# GuideFormError.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\userGuide\form\GuideFormError.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component displays form validation errors in a dialog popup for a user guide form in an e-commerce application. It renders an error message in a styled error dialog with a close button that allows users to dismiss the error by setting it to undefined. The component uses a red-themed color scheme (`utilitary-error-*` classes) and includes a small triangular pointer using CSS transforms to visually connect the error to its source field.
