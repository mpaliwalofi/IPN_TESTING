**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\userGuide\form\GuideFormInput.vue`

## Summary
This Vue 3 component provides a reusable form input field for the user guide feature in an e-commerce application. It implements two-way data binding via v-model, supports optional labels, error messages, and unit displays (e.g., for measurements like "kg" or "cm"), with special styling states for error and no-label scenarios. The component uses Vue's Composition API with TypeScript and includes conditional CSS classes to handle different visual states like disabled inputs, floating labels, and right-aligned unit indicators.
