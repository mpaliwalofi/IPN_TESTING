**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\userGuide\form\__tests__\GuideFormError.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a unit test file for the `GuideFormError.vue` component in an e-commerce user guide feature. It tests the component's ability to conditionally display and dismiss an error dialog based on the `error` prop, verifying that the dialog appears when an error is present, disappears when the close button is clicked, and matches expected snapshot renderings. The tests ensure proper error feedback functionality within the user guide form interface.
