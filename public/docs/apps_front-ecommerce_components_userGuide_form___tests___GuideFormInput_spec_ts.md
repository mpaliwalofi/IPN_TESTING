## Summary
This is a test file for the `GuideFormInput.vue` component in an e-commerce application's user guide feature. It verifies that the input component correctly handles two-way data binding (v-model), emits appropriate events when users type, responds reactively to prop changes, respects disabled state, and renders correctly through snapshot testing. The tests ensure the form input behaves as expected for collecting user guide-related information with proper Vue component communication patterns.
