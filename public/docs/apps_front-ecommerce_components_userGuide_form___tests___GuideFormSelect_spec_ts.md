## Summary
This is a test suite for the `GuideFormSelect.vue` component, which appears to be a custom select dropdown used in an e-commerce user guide feature for selecting pet breeds. The tests verify that the component correctly handles user selection events (emitting both 'input' and 'update:modelValue'), responds reactively to prop changes, respects disabled state, and renders properly with API-formatted breed data that includes an '@id' property key and label.
