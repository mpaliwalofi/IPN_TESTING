**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\components\userGuide\form\__tests__\GuideFormToggle.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a unit test file for the `GuideFormToggle.vue` component, which appears to be a toggle button group used in an e-commerce user guide form (likely for selecting options like gender). The tests verify that the toggle correctly handles user interactions (clicking buttons to change selection), responds to prop changes reactively, respects disabled state, and renders correctly according to snapshots.
