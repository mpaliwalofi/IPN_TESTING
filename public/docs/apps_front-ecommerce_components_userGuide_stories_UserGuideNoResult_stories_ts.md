## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file that defines visual documentation and testing scenarios for the `UserGuideNoResult` Vue component in an e-commerce application. It exports a single "Default" story that demonstrates how the component renders when there are no user guide search results, wrapped in a Suspense component with a loading fallback. The story allows developers and designers to preview and interact with the no-results state of the user guide feature in isolation.
