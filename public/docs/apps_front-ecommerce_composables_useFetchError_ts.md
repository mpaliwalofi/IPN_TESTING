## Summary
This composable provides error handling wrapper for Promise-based operations in an e-commerce front-end application. It resolves a promise (or value) and automatically displays any caught errors using a `showError` function, allowing developers to handle async operations without explicitly writing catch blocks for error display throughout the application.
