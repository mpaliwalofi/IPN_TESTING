**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\composables\useMentionMe.ts`

## Summary
This composable provides integration with the MentionMe referral marketing platform for an e-commerce application. It generates and injects tracking scripts dynamically into the page head for different customer journey stages (checkout and order confirmation), constructing parameterized script URLs and managing tag firing state to prevent duplicate tracking events. The implementation supports localization and can be conditionally enabled/disabled via runtime configuration.
