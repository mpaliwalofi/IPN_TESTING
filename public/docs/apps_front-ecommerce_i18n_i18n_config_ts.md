## Summary
This file configures internationalization (i18n) settings for a front-end e-commerce application supporting French and Dutch locales (including regional variants for France, Belgium, and Netherlands). It defines date formatting patterns (medium format with day, month, year) and number formatting rules (currency in EUR and decimal formats) for each supported locale, while also enabling global injection and suppressing translation warnings.
