## Summary
This is a French language localization file that defines URL route mappings for an e-commerce website specializing in pet food and nutrition. It translates English route names into their French URL equivalents, covering core functionality like shopping cart ("/panier/"), user account management ("/mon-compte/"), product catalog ("/produits/"), pet profiles ("/mes-animaux/"), subscriptions, and a pet nutrition guide ("/guide-croquettes/"). The file enables the application to serve French-language URLs while maintaining consistent internal route naming across different locales.
