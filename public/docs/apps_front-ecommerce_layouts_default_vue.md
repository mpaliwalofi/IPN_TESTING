**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\layouts\default.vue`

## Summary
This is a Nuxt 3 default layout component for an e-commerce front-end that manages global modal displays and UI state. It listens for custom application hooks to conditionally show various modals including an exit popup, language/country switcher walls, and markdown content modals based on tracking/analytics events. The layout also supports a minimal display mode through route meta properties and integrates with a custom router system for navigation control.
