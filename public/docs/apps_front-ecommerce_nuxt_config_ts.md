**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\nuxt.config.ts`

## Summary
This is a Nuxt.js configuration file for a front-end e-commerce application that sets up multi-locale support for French and Dutch languages across Belgium, France, and Netherlands markets. It configures internationalization (i18n) routing, locale-specific translation files, and allows environment-based builds targeting specific countries and language combinations. The configuration also integrates custom e-commerce modules, sets up component paths, and includes build versioning metadata for deployment tracking.
