# package.json

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\package.json`

## Summary
This is a package.json configuration file for an e-commerce front-end application built with Nuxt.js. It defines build scripts, development workflows, and dependencies with a focus on orchestrating builds through Nx (monorepo tool) that depend on a separate "nuxt-ecommerce" module. The configuration includes tooling for SVG optimization and font generation from SVG sources, along with standard development tasks like linting, testing with Vitest, and Husky for git hooks.
