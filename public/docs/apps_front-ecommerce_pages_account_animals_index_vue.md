## Summary
This Vue page component serves as the Animals management section within a customer's e-commerce account area. It displays a list of the customer's registered animals (if any exist) with conditional headers, implements authentication middleware to protect access, and renders dynamic CMS-driven content through a composite page system. The page includes tracking analytics on mount and provides navigation back to the account menu, with the entire layout being controlled by Strapi CMS content for the 'b2c-animals-page'.
