# index.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\pages\account\index.vue`

## Summary
This is the account homepage route for returning/authenticated users in an e-commerce application. It dynamically loads and renders CMS-managed composite page content specifically configured for logged-in customers (b2c-home-page-return-user), with integrated analytics tracking for monitoring return user engagement. The page uses a middleware to handle anonymous user redirects and renders different content compared to first-time visitors.
