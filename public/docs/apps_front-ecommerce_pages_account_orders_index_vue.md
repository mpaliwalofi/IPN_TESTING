## Summary
This Vue component displays a user's order history page in an e-commerce application. It fetches and renders a list of orders with the most recent order displayed separately, handles authentication and feature-flag middleware, and integrates with a CMS for page content and metadata. The page includes navigation back to the account menu, conditional headers based on whether orders exist, and tracking/analytics functionality for page views.
