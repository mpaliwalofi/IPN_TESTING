## Summary
This Vue component implements a customer account personal data management page for an e-commerce application. It provides three forms for authenticated users: updating personal information, changing passwords, and managing language/locale preferences, all of which interact with the customer store and redirect back to the account menu upon successful submission. The page includes CMS integration for content display and tracking functionality for monitoring user account interactions.
