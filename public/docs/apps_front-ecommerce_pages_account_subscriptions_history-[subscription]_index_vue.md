## Summary
This Vue page component displays the order history for a specific customer subscription in an e-commerce application. It fetches and filters subscription orders (excluding drafts) based on the subscription code from the URL route parameter, then renders them with CMS-driven content and tracking capabilities. The page is protected by authentication middleware and includes navigation back to the main subscription details page.
