## Summary
This Vue page component manages the user's subscription listing view in the e-commerce account section. It displays all active user subscriptions, provides navigation back to the account menu, and handles subscription-related modals while enforcing authentication and subscription feature availability through middleware. The page integrates with a CMS composite page system for content management and includes tracking functionality for analytics purposes.
