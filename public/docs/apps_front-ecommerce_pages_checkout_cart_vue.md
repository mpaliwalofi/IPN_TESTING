# cart.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\pages\checkout\cart.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component implements the shopping cart page for an e-commerce application. It loads and displays the cart contents using a cart store, handles product variant additions from URL query parameters, and renders dynamic content sections (cart items and cross-sell products) using a composable page rendering system. The page also integrates tracking functionality for cart page views and includes loading states while cart data is being fetched.
