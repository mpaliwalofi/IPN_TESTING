## Summary
This Vue component serves as the contact page for a B2C e-commerce application, integrating with a Strapi CMS to render dynamic page content. It fetches and displays composite page data from the CMS using the 'b2c-contact-page' identifier, renders the page components using a CompositeRenderer, and tracks page view events for analytics purposes when the component is mounted.
