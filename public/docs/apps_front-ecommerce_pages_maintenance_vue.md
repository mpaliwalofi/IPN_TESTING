**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\pages\maintenance.vue`

## Summary
This is a maintenance page component for an e-commerce application that displays a temporary service unavailable message to users. It sets up the page context with a maintenance title, clears any existing errors before navigation, loads cross-sell product recommendations, and renders a localized maintenance message with markdown support. The page serves as a user-friendly holding screen during planned downtime while still providing some product discovery through cross-sell items.
