**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\pages\search.vue`

## Summary
This is a Vue.js search page component for an e-commerce front-end that renders a dynamic CMS-driven search results page. It fetches page content and metadata from a Strapi CMS backend using the 'b2c-search-page' identifier, sets up page tracking analytics, and renders the page components using a composite pattern with breadcrumb navigation. The page supports dynamic component rendering based on CMS configuration and includes development debugging capabilities.
