## Summary
This is a shop listing/index page for an e-commerce front-end that uses a CMS-driven composite page architecture. It dynamically renders page content by fetching shop context metadata, displaying a breadcrumb navigation and page title, then rendering CMS-defined components through the CompositeRenderer based on the page configuration. The page also initializes analytics tracking and preloads a Booxi booking widget on mount for scheduling functionality.
