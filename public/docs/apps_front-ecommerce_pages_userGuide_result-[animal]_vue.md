## Summary
This Vue component serves as the user guide results page for pet product recommendations in an e-commerce application. It loads personalized product suggestions based on a specific animal (passed as a route parameter), retrieves corresponding product details from both Strapi and Sylius systems, and tracks user interactions with the recommendation results. The page handles the display of recommended products after a pet owner completes a guided questionnaire about their animal, integrating with the customer store and product catalog to present tailored shopping recommendations.
