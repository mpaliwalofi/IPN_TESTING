# [subscription]-PaymentChange.vue

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\pages\webView\[subscription]-PaymentChange.vue`

## Summary
This Vue page component handles payment method changes for customer subscriptions in an e-commerce application's web view. It fetches subscription data based on a dynamic route parameter, displays debugging information including user details, subscription data, and browser/device detection (specifically checking for iOS Safari and standalone mode), and requires authentication with web view permissions to access. The page appears to be in development/debugging state given the raw data display rather than a production-ready payment change interface.

## Function Details
