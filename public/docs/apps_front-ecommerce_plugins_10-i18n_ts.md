## Summary
This Nuxt plugin manages data cleanup during internationalization (i18n) locale switching in an e-commerce application. It hooks into the i18n lifecycle to clear cached catalog products and CMS pages when the user changes language, ensuring fresh localized content is loaded instead of stale data from the previous locale.
