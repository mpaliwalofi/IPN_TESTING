## Summary
This Nuxt plugin initializes and configures Google Tag Manager (GTM) for client-side e-commerce tracking, supporting both standard GTM and a "ghost" mode (likely for testing/development). It sets up the GTM instance with configurable options, sends an initial tracking event with store/country information, and integrates GTM with the application's custom tracking hooks system to enable data layer events throughout the e-commerce application.
