# project.json

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\project.json`

## Summary
This is an Nx workspace project configuration file for a front-end e-commerce application named "front-ecommerce". It defines the project as an application type and establishes a build dependency on another project called "nuxt-ecommerce", indicating this is likely a wrapper or orchestration layer for a Nuxt.js-based e-commerce storefront. The configuration enables Nx to manage build orchestration and ensure dependent projects are built in the correct order.
