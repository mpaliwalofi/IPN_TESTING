## Summary
This TypeScript declaration file provides type definitions for Vue Single File Components (.vue files) to enable proper TypeScript support in the front-ecommerce application. It tells TypeScript that any imported .vue file should be treated as a Vue component with the DefineComponent type, allowing the TypeScript compiler to recognize and validate Vue component imports without throwing module resolution errors.
