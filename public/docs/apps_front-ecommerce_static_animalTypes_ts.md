## Summary
This file defines constant configuration objects for animal-related data used in an e-commerce application, specifically for pet products. It exports three immutable constant objects that map animal types (dog/cat), genders (male/female), and special breed options to their corresponding API endpoint IRIs and identifiers, enabling type-safe references to these entities throughout the application when filtering or categorizing pet products.
