## Summary
This module defines constant string identifiers for HTML body element attributes that track user authentication and subscription states in the e-commerce application. These attributes are likely used to conditionally apply CSS styles or enable/disable UI features based on whether a user is logged in, subscribed, or anonymous, providing a centralized reference for these state indicators across the frontend.
