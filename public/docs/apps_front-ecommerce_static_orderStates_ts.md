**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\static\orderStates.ts`

## Summary
This file defines constant enumerations for tracking e-commerce order lifecycle states across four distinct dimensions: overall order status, payment status, shipping status, and checkout progress. These immutable state constants serve as a single source of truth for managing order workflows throughout the front-end e-commerce application, ensuring consistent state handling across components when processing customer orders from cart creation through payment, fulfillment, and potential cancellations or refunds.
