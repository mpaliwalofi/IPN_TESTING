## Summary
This file defines a constant object that serves as a centralized registry of content identifiers for different sections of a subscription management interface in an e-commerce application. The string keys map to content block identifiers (likely used with a CMS or content management system) for subscription-related pages including card details, payment, delivery, shipping, order history, and FAQ sections. This allows the application to reference and render subscription page content consistently across the front-end by using these standardized identifiers.
