# productPageStates.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\static\productPageStates.ts`

## Summary
This TypeScript file defines constant enumerations and their corresponding types for managing different states and types of product pages in an e-commerce application with subscription functionality. It establishes two main sets of constants: `SHOPPING_PANEL_STATES` which tracks user connection and subscription status (e.g., not connected, has single/multiple subscriptions), and `PRODUCT_PAGE_TYPES` which differentiates between classic product pages and subscription-based product pages (catalog vs. account subscriptions). These exported constants and types are likely used throughout the application to control UI rendering and business logic based on the user's subscription state and the type of product page being viewed.
