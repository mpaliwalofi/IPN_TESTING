# searchIndexes.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\static\searchIndexes.ts`

## Summary
This file defines and exports the configuration for Algolia search indexes used in an e-commerce front-end application. It provides a TypeScript interface (`IAlgoliaIndexes`) that structures search indexes for different content types (products, categories, articles, FAQs) and includes sections for display results, suggestions, and a unified "all_tabs" index. The default export provides minimal configuration with only the "all" index populated, serving as a base configuration that can be extended with specific index names for each search category.
