## Summary
This file defines a constant enumeration object that represents the possible states of a subscription in an e-commerce application. It provides a type-safe way to reference subscription statuses (active, error, paused, stopped) throughout the front-end codebase, ensuring consistency when handling subscription lifecycle management and preventing magic string usage.
