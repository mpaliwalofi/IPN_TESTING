# trackingViewEvent.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\static\trackingViewEvent.ts`

## Summary
This TypeScript file defines constants for tracking page view events in an e-commerce application, specifically for a pet-related business (indicated by "Add animal" and "Edit animal" events). It exports two constant objects: `TRACKINGVIEWEVENT` containing identifiers for various pages and user flows (homepage, product pages, checkout funnel, animal management, etc.), and `TRACKINGVIEWEVENTCATEGORIES` for categorizing user guide interactions, which are likely used for analytics and monitoring user navigation throughout the application.
