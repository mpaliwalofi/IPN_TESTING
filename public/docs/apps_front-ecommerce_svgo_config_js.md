# svgo.config.js

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\svgo.config.js`

## Summary
This is an SVGO (SVG Optimizer) configuration file for the front-ecommerce application that defines how SVG files should be optimized during the build process. It uses the default preset of optimization plugins while specifically preserving viewBox attributes (which are important for responsive SVGs) and removes fixed width/height dimensions to allow flexible scaling of SVG assets in the e-commerce frontend.
