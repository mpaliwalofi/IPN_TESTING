## Summary
This file exports mock data representing different animal body condition classifications (weight categories) for an e-commerce application, ranging from underweight to obese. It provides test data that simulates API responses for animal condition endpoints, allowing developers to test UI components and functionality without making actual API calls. The mock includes French language labels for five standard veterinary body condition scores commonly used in pet health assessments.
