## Summary
This file provides mock data representing animal profiles for testing the e-commerce front-end application. It exports TypeScript objects that simulate API responses from a pet-related e-commerce platform, including detailed animal information such as breed, gender, physical condition, activity level, diet preferences, and photos. The mock data follows the Hydra API specification format and is used for testing components that display and manage pet profiles in the shop's account section.
