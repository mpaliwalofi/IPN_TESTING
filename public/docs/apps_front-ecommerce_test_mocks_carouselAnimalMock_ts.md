## Summary
This file provides mock data for testing an animal carousel feature in an e-commerce front-end application. It exports three test scenarios: a full carousel with multiple animals (dogs and cats) containing their details like name, type, photo, and age; a carousel with a single animal; and an empty carousel state. The mock data follows a Hydra JSON-LD API format structure, simulating responses from the shop's animal management API endpoints.
