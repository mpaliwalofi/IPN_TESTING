# categoryGrid.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\test\mocks\categoryGrid.ts`

## Summary
This mock data file provides test fixtures for a category grid component in an e-commerce front-end application. It exports a sample category grid object (`categoryGridDefault`) containing image metadata with multiple responsive format variants (thumbnail, small, medium, large) hosted on ImageKit CDN, structured to match the expected API response from a headless CMS (likely Strapi based on the `__component` naming convention). This mock is used for testing UI components that display product category grids without requiring actual API calls.
