## Summary
This mock data file provides test data for cross-sell product functionality in an e-commerce application. It defines a product recommendation configuration with a main product ID ('009006') and an array of related product IDs that would be displayed as "New &amp; Best Sellers" recommendations to encourage additional purchases. This mock is used for testing the cross-sell feature without requiring actual API calls or database queries.
