## Summary
This file exports a mock data object representing a "double-edito" component for an e-commerce front-end, specifically used for testing purposes. It contains structured content for a subscription promotion feature, including text content (title, markdown bullet points about subscription benefits with 10% discount), layout configuration flags (textRight, background, mobileImageFirst), and associated image data with multiple format variations (large, small, medium) hosted on ImageKit CDN. The mock simulates the data structure returned from a CMS (likely Strapi based on the component naming convention) for rendering editorial/promotional sections in the application.
