## Summary
This file provides mock data for an "edito" (editorial content) component in an e-commerce frontend, specifically representing a promotional banner about a 10% subscription discount. The mock includes structured content with a title, markdown-formatted instructional text, layout configuration flags, and associated responsive image data in multiple formats (large, medium, small) for testing UI rendering without requiring actual CMS API calls.
