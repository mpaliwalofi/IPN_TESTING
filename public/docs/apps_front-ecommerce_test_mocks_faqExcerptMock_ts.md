## Summary
This TypeScript file exports a mock data object representing a FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) component for a French e-commerce pet food website. The mock contains structured FAQ data including questions about delivery address changes, subscription functionality, and subscription setup, formatted to match the expected data structure from a CMS (likely Strapi based on the `__component` field). This mock is used for testing purposes to simulate API responses without requiring actual backend calls.
