## Summary
This file exports a mock dataset of FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) entries for a French e-commerce pet food website. The mock data contains questions and answers about delivery addresses, subscription services, and subscription modifications, structured with IDs, attributes (question, response, slug), and metadata (timestamps, locale). It's used for testing components that display or interact with FAQ content without requiring actual API calls or database connections.
