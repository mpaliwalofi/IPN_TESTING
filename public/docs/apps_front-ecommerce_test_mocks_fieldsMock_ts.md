**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\test\mocks\fieldsMock.ts`

## Summary
This TypeScript file provides mock data for form field testing in an e-commerce front-end application. It exports pre-configured field objects representing different input types (select, email, text, textarea, file upload, checkbox) with French labels and validation error messages, simulating a contact or customer information form. These mocks are used for unit testing form components without requiring actual API data or database connections.
