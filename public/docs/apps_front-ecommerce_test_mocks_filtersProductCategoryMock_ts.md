## Summary
This file provides mock data for product category filters in an e-commerce application, specifically for pet products (dogs). It exports a `groupsFilters` array containing filter groups like "Taille" (Size) and "Spécificités" (Specifications) with nested filter options such as puppy, small/medium/large dogs, and sterilized pets, used for testing filtering functionality in the front-end application.
