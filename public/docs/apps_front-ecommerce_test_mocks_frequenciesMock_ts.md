## Summary
This file exports mock data representing subscription or delivery frequency options for an e-commerce application. It provides test data for various time intervals (ranging from 21 to 155 days) with French labels, which would be used to simulate API responses for frequency selection features during testing, likely for recurring orders or subscription-based purchases.
