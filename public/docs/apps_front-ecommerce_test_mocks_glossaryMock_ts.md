## Summary
This file exports a mock data object representing a glossary component for a B2C e-commerce application focused on pet food products. The mock provides sample data for testing purposes, including a glossary of high-quality ingredients with their titles, descriptions, and associated images (like animal proteins and fish), formatted to match the structure expected from a CMS API response. This allows developers to test the glossary UI component without requiring live backend API calls.
