## Summary
This file exports a mock data object for testing a hero slider component in an e-commerce front-end application. It contains structured test data including slide content (images, titles, subtitles), French localization elements (country flags, customer testimonials), call-to-action buttons for dog and cat product categories, and configuration settings like slide duration (3000ms), simulating the actual API response structure used by the hero banner carousel.
