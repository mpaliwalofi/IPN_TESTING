## Summary
This file exports a mock data object representing a blog grid component for an e-commerce pet food website. It contains structured test data for a "Dossiers Pratiques Alimentation" (Practical Food Guides) blog section, including multiple articles about pet nutrition topics like gluten-free kibble and dietary transitions, each with associated metadata (titles, images, slugs, and categories). This mock is used for testing UI components that display blog article grids in the front-end application.
