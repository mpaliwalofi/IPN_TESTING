## Summary
This file provides mock data for testing a product category listing component in an e-commerce application, specifically for the Ultra Premium Direct pet food website. The mock includes structured test data for category push cards (with promotional content like puppy welcome kits), product filters organized by groups (e.g., grain-free kibble, low-grain options), and associated metadata like URLs, images, and tracking parameters used to render and filter dog food product categories.
