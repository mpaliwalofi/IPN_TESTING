## Summary
This file exports a mock data object representing the structure of a mega menu for a French pet e-commerce website. It contains promotional banner configurations, navigation menu items for different pet categories (primarily dogs/"Chien"), and nested panel structures with product category links (e.g., dog food, puppy food) including associated metadata like URLs, labels, and images. The mock is used for testing menu rendering and navigation functionality in the front-end e-commerce application.
