## Summary
This file exports a mock configuration object for the Mention-Me referral marketing platform integration, used for testing the e-commerce front-end application. It provides test values for the Mention-Me domain endpoint, account identifier, and French locale settings that would typically be used during development and automated testing to avoid making real API calls to the Mention-Me service.
