## Summary
This file provides mock data for order objects used in testing the front-end e-commerce application. It contains a detailed `baseOrder` constant that represents a complete order structure with nested payment methods (Google Pay), shipping information (DPD shipping), and multi-language translations for French and Dutch locales, mirroring the API v2 response format for shop orders.
