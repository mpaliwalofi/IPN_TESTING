## Summary
This file exports a mock dataset of dog food products for testing purposes in an e-commerce application. It contains detailed product information including SKUs, pricing (both regular and subscription), inventory status, product variants (different weights like 12kg), customer ratings, and multilingual product descriptions for grain-free dog food items targeted at dogs with sensitive digestion. The mock data structure mirrors the production API response format, allowing developers to test product listing and display functionality without requiring live backend services.
