## Summary
This mock data file provides test fixtures for a product recommendation system in a French e-commerce pet store application. It contains a predefined list of 8 dog product IDs with their complete product details (names, classifications, slugs, and recommendation scores) covering various categories like food, treats, grooming items, and toys. The mock is used to simulate recommendation API responses during testing without requiring actual backend calls.
