## Summary
This file contains mock data representing shopping cart orders for testing purposes in an e-commerce application. It provides sample JSON-LD formatted order objects that include complete payment methods (like PAYZEN for bank card payments), shipping methods (like DPDPREDICT-FR), and multi-locale translations (French/Belgian/Dutch), simulating the structure returned by the API's v2 shop endpoints for use in unit and integration tests.
