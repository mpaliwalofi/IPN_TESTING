## Summary
This file provides mock data for testing Strapi-based e-commerce product functionality, specifically representing a grain-free cat food product for sterilized/indoor adult cats. It exports product variant data (different package sizes with pricing, SKUs, and stock information) and a main product object containing metadata like title, description, ratings, and classification for use in front-end e-commerce tests.
