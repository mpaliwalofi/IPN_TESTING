## Summary
This file exports a mock subscription object that simulates an e-commerce subscription API response. It provides test data for a recurring product subscription (pet food) including billing/shipping addresses, subscription interval (62 days), next shipping date, and associated product variant details. This mock is used for testing subscription-related features in the front-end e-commerce application without requiring actual API calls.
