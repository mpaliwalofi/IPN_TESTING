# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for a Nuxt-based e-commerce front-end application. It extends the base Nuxt TypeScript configuration and declares type definitions for internationalization (i18n), testing frameworks (Vitest, Testing Library), and payment integrations (Google Maps, Google Pay, Apple Pay). The configuration establishes project references to a shared `nuxt-ecommerce` module and defines which files to include/exclude from TypeScript compilation.
