## Summary
This TypeScript file defines a strict enumeration of page types used in a B2C e-commerce CMS content management system. It establishes five distinct page categories (B2C category, FAQ subjects, homepage, generic page, and shop) as immutable constants and exports a corresponding type for type-safe page type references throughout the application. This serves as a central schema definition to ensure consistent page type identification across the front-end e-commerce platform's CMS integration.
