## Summary
This TypeScript module defines type constants and their corresponding TypeScript types for a subscription management feature in an e-commerce CMS. It establishes two enums: `ACTIVE_TAB` to distinguish between draft and active subscription states, and `SUBSCRIPTION_CONTACT_MODE` to handle different user contact scenarios (updating information vs. asking questions). These types provide type-safe constants for UI state management in the subscription workflow.

## Type Aliases
- `TActiveTab`
