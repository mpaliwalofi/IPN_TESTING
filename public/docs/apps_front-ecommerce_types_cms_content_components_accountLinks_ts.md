## Summary
This TypeScript module defines a type interface for an account links component in a Strapi-based e-commerce CMS. It extends the base Strapi component structure to include an array of dashboard button CTAs (`ctaDashboards`), representing navigational links or actions available in a user account section. This type provides compile-time safety for rendering account-related navigation elements from CMS content.
