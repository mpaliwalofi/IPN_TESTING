## Summary
This TypeScript definition file defines the `IExpertise` interface for a CMS content component in an e-commerce front-end application. It structures expertise/promotional section data with responsive imagery (desktop and mobile variants), multiple description fields, an optional call-to-action button, and integrates with the Strapi headless CMS through its type system. The interface enables type-safe rendering of multi-section expertise or feature showcase components on the e-commerce storefront.
