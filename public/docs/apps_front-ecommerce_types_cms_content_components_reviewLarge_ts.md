## Summary
This TypeScript file defines type interfaces for a large review component in an e-commerce CMS system. It structures review data with two main interfaces: `IReview` (individual review details including author, comment, rating, date, and image) and `IReviewLarge` (a Strapi component that aggregates multiple reviews with overall rating statistics, a title, and a call-to-action button). These types enable type-safe handling of customer review sections displayed on product or service pages.

## Interfaces
- `IReview`
- `IReviewLarge`
