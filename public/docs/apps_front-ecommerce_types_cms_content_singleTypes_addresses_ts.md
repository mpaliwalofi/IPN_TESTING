## Summary
This TypeScript file defines a type for a CMS-managed addresses page in an e-commerce application. It extends the base Strapi composite page interface to include specific header text fields for displaying address listings (`addresses_header`) and handling empty states when no addresses exist (`no_addresses_header`). This type structure enables type-safe content management for the customer addresses interface through the Strapi CMS.
