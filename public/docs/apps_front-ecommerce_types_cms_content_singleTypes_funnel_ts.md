## Summary
This TypeScript file defines the type structure for an e-commerce checkout funnel page in a Strapi CMS-based system. It extends the base composite page type to include specific checkout steps (shipping and payment) as collections of Strapi components, along with available payment options. The type serves as a contract for managing the multi-step checkout flow content and configuration in the CMS.
