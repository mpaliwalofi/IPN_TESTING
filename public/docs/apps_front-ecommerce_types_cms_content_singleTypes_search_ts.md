## Summary
This TypeScript file defines the type structure for a composite search page in an e-commerce CMS, extending the base static page interface with search index configurations. It specifies four different search indexes (articles, categories, products, and product suggestions), each with an index identifier string and an optional boolean flag to enable/disable that particular search functionality. The type is designed to configure which content types are searchable and how they're indexed in the front-end e-commerce application's search feature.
