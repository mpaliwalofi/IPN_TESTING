## Summary
This TypeScript file defines a type interface for a subscription-related CMS page in an e-commerce application. It extends a base composite page type with subscription-specific properties including product index configurations, suggestion indices, and content sections for next order functionality. The interface serves as a contract for managing subscription page data fetched from a Strapi CMS, allowing control over which product catalogs and search suggestions are displayed and enabled on the subscription management interface.
