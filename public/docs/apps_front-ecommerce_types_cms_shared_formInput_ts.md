## Summary
This TypeScript definition file declares the `IFormInput` interface that represents the structure of form input fields in the e-commerce CMS. It defines properties for standard form field attributes (id, label, name, type, value, required) along with validation state (error, checked) and supports select dropdown inputs through integration with the SmartForm library's choice options. This type is used to maintain consistent form field data structures across the front-end e-commerce application's CMS components.
