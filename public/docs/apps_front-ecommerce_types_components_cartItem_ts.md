## Summary
This TypeScript definitions file declares interfaces for shopping cart-related items in an e-commerce application. It defines three core types: `ICartItem` (representing products in the cart with pricing, quantity, and product metadata), `ICartUpSell` (for upsell product suggestions), and `ICartCrossSell` (extending upsells with promotional tracking configurations).
