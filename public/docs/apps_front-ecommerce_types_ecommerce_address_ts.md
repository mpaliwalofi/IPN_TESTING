## Summary
This TypeScript file defines address data structures for an e-commerce application built on the Sylius platform. It exports two interfaces: `IAddress` for general address information (including phone numbers, street details, country/postal codes, and optional Mondial Relay delivery service fields) and `ICustomerAddress` which extends `IAddress` with customer-specific properties like an alias and default address flag for managing saved shipping/billing addresses.

## Interfaces
- `IAddress`
- `ICustomerAddress`
