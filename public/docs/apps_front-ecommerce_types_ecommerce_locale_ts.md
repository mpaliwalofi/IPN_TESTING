## Summary
This TypeScript file defines type definitions for internationalization (i18n) and localization in an e-commerce application. It specifies the structure for locale configurations (including language, country, and translation files), individual country settings (with navigation links, availability status, and flag display), and a collection type for managing multiple countries. These types enable type-safe handling of multi-language and multi-region support across the e-commerce frontend.
