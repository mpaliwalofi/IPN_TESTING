## Summary
This TypeScript definitions file defines the data structures for pickup point functionality in an e-commerce application. It specifies interfaces for representing physical pickup locations with their addresses, operating hours by day of week, geographic coordinates for mapping, associated shipping methods with pricing, and closure periods. These types enable the front-end to manage and display pickup point selection features where customers can choose to collect their orders from designated locations instead of home delivery.

## Interfaces
- `IPickupPointDays`
- `IPickupPointShippingMethod`
- `IPickupPoint`
- `IPickupPointProps`
