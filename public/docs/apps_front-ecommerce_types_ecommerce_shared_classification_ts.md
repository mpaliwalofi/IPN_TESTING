## Summary
This TypeScript file defines a product classification system for a pet e-commerce platform, categorizing products for dogs, cats, and other pets into types like food (dry/wet), samples, shampoo, supplements, treats, and litter. The classifications use French naming conventions (e.g., 'chien_croquettes' for dog kibble, 'chat_litiere' for cat litter) and include a grouping system that organizes products by unit of measurement (kg for food items, l for litter). This structure likely supports product categorization, filtering, and inventory management throughout the e-commerce application.
