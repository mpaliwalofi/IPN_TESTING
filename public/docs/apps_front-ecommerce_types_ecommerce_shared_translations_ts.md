## Summary
This TypeScript file defines a type interface for handling multilingual translations in an e-commerce application. It provides a flexible structure where translation keys map to objects containing localized content properties like name, title, description, and locale identifiers, along with optional JSON-LD metadata (@id, @type). The interface supports the translation system by allowing different content fields to be stored and accessed per language/locale in the e-commerce front-end.
