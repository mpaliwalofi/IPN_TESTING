## Summary
This TypeScript file defines type definitions for shopping cart and product interaction functionality in an e-commerce application. It establishes the data structures needed to manage product variants (combining Strapi CMS and Sylius commerce data), shopping options (frequency and quantity), and cart operation events like adding items to cart or adding product samples. These types serve as contracts for components that handle product display, selection, and purchase workflows across the front-end e-commerce application.
