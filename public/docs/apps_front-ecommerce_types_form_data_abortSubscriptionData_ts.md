# abortSubscriptionData.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\types\form\data\abortSubscriptionData.ts`

## Summary
This file defines a TypeScript type and Zod validation schema for handling subscription cancellation requests in an e-commerce application. It specifies that an abort subscription request must include two required string fields: a `reason` (likely a predefined category) and a `message` (presumably for additional user input explaining the cancellation). The schema ensures type safety and runtime validation for subscription cancellation form data throughout the application.
