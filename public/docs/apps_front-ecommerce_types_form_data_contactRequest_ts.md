# contactRequest.ts

**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\types\form\data\contactRequest.ts`

## Summary
This TypeScript file defines a Zod schema and type for contact request form data in an e-commerce front-end application. Currently, the `ContactRequestSchema` is an empty object placeholder, suggesting it's either a stub for future implementation or awaiting definition of contact form fields (like name, email, message, etc.). The exported type `TContactRequest` would be used for type-safe handling of contact form submissions throughout the application.

## Type Aliases
- `TContactRequest`
