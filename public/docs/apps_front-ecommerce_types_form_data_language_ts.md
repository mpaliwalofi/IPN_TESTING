## Summary
This TypeScript file defines a Zod schema and type for language configuration in an e-commerce application. The `LanguageSchema` validates language data structures containing country information (code and optional href) and language details (code, language name, and optional default flag). It serves as a type-safe contract for handling multi-language/internationalization settings, likely used for language selection and localization features throughout the e-commerce front-end.
