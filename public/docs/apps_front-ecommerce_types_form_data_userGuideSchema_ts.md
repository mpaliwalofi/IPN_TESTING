## Summary
This file defines Zod validation schemas for a multi-step user guide form in an e-commerce application, specifically for collecting pet information. The schemas validate pet details across multiple steps, including required fields like pet type, gender, name, breed information, and birthday in step 1, and physical characteristics like sterilization status, weight, body condition, and activity level in step 2, with custom validation logic to ensure critical pet profile data is properly captured before proceeding.
