## Summary
This TypeScript file defines the `MutationRequestForm` class that dynamically builds contact/support form schemas for an e-commerce platform. It transforms CMS-defined form inputs (text fields, dropdowns, file uploads, checkboxes, etc.) into validated SmartForm field definitions, with special handling for user-specific data like orders and products, and integrates with a Zod-based validation schema for contact requests.
