## Summary
This class defines a smart form for calculating pet food rations in an e-commerce application. It dynamically constructs form fields based on the calculator type (adult dog vs. puppy/chiot), including weight input for all types and an additional age in months field specifically for puppies. The form validates input against a RationCalculatorSchema and handles submission callbacks to compute appropriate food portions.
