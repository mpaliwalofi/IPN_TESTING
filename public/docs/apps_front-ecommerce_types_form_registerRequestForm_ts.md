## Summary
This class defines a registration form for new e-commerce customers, configuring the fields and validation rules needed for user account creation. It extends a SmartForm framework to create a structured form with fields for gender selection, personal information (first/last name), credentials (password), optional birthday, and newsletter subscription preferences. The form validates input against a RegisterRequestSchema and executes a callback function when successfully submitted with valid data.
