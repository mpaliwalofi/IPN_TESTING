## Summary
This class defines a tracking event specifically for monitoring when users add promotional coupon codes in an e-commerce application. It extends the base `TrackingEvent` class to capture coupon code and location data, then formats it for Google Tag Manager (GTM) with event details like 'add_coupon' action and click tracking. The event data structure is designed to integrate with GTM's analytics pipeline for tracking coupon usage across different locations in the application.
