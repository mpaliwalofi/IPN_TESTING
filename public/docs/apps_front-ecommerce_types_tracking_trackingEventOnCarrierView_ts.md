## Summary
This class defines a custom tracking event for monitoring when users view carrier/shipping options during the e-commerce checkout process. It extends the base `TrackingEvent` class to create a specialized "carrier_view" event that maps to a "checkout" event name in the analytics data, enabling the front-end e-commerce application to track user progression through the shipping selection step of the purchase flow.
