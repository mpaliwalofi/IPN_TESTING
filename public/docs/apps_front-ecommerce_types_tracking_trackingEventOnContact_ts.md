## Summary
This class implements a tracking event specifically for contact form interactions in an e-commerce application. It captures contact attempt details (email, success/failure status, and location) and formats them for Google Tag Manager (GTM) by combining event metadata with user data, conditionally including the email address for non-logged-in users. The event is used to monitor contact form submissions and their outcomes across different pages of the site.
