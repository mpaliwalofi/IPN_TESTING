## Summary
This code defines a tracking event class specifically for monitoring user account creation in an e-commerce application. It extends a base `TrackingEvent` class to create a Google Tag Manager custom event with the name 'create_account', which gets fired when a user successfully creates an account. This allows the application to track account registration conversions and user acquisition metrics through GTM.
