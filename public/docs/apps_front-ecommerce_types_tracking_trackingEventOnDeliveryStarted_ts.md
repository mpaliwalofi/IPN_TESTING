## Summary
This class defines a tracking event for when a delivery process starts in an e-commerce checkout flow. It extends the base `TrackingEvent` class with a specific event type 'delivery_started' while overriding the data output to categorize it under the 'checkout' event name for analytics purposes. This allows the application to monitor and track when customers progress to the delivery stage of their purchase journey.
