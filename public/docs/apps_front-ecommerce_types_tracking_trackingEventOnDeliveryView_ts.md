## Summary
This class defines a tracking event for monitoring delivery/checkout page views in an e-commerce application. It extends a base `TrackingEvent` class to create a specialized event named 'delivery_view' that maps to a 'checkout' event in the tracking data, allowing analytics systems to capture when users reach the delivery information step of the checkout process.
