## Summary
This class defines a tracking event specifically for monitoring user interactions with subscription form editing functionality in an e-commerce application. It extends a base `TrackingEvent` class to capture click events on subscription edit forms, recording the event label and location for Google Tag Manager analytics. The event data structure includes standardized GTM properties (event_name, event_action, event_label, event_location) to track where and how users interact with subscription modification features.
