## Summary
This class defines a tracking event for e-commerce filter interactions, capturing when users add or remove filter choices in the product browsing experience. It extends a base TrackingEvent class to send custom GTM (Google Tag Manager) events with specific metadata including the filter label and whether the filter was added or removed. The event data is formatted for analytics tracking to monitor user filtering behavior on the e-commerce platform.
