## Summary
This class implements a Google Tag Manager tracking event specifically for modal interactions (views and clicks) in an e-commerce application. It extends the base `TrackingEvent` class to capture modal-specific data including the modal name, page template context, and whether the event represents a view or click action, which is then formatted for GTM consumption via the `toData()` method.
