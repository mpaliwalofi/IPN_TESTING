## Summary
This class implements a tracking event specifically for newsletter subscription actions in an e-commerce application. It captures the user's email and subscription success status, then formats this data for Google Tag Manager (GTM) by including user information, event details (name, action, label), and conditional email data based on whether the user is logged in or anonymous.
