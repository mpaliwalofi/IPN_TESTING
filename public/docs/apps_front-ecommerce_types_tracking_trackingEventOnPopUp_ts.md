## Summary
This class implements a specialized tracking event for monitoring user interactions with pop-ups in an e-commerce application. It extends a base `TrackingEvent` class to capture pop-up analytics by recording whether a pop-up was viewed or clicked, along with a descriptive label, and formats this data for Google Tag Manager (GTM) with the event name 'pop_up'. The class is used to send structured tracking data to analytics systems to measure pop-up engagement and effectiveness.
