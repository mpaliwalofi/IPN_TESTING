## Summary
This class represents a tracking event specifically for Salesforce form submissions in an e-commerce application. It extends a base `TrackingEvent` class to capture form-specific metadata (form ID, name, destination, and submit button text) and formats it for Google Tag Manager (GTM) analytics with a standardized "form_submit" event structure.
