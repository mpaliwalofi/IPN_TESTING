## Summary
This class implements a tracking event specifically for search operations in an e-commerce application, capturing search analytics data for Google Tag Manager (GTM). When a search is performed, it records the search term, location, and transforms product data (including prices, ratings, reviews, and categorization) into a standardized GTM-compatible format with proper indexing and item list attribution for analytics purposes.
