## Summary
This class implements a tracking event for Google Tag Manager (GTM) that fires when a user selects a product item in an e-commerce context. It extends a base `TrackingEvent` class and transforms product data (including SKU, title, price, ratings, and classification) into the standardized GTM ecommerce format, enriching it with list source information and position data for analytics purposes.
