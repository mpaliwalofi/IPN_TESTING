## Summary
This class defines a tracking event specifically for when a user selects a home delivery shipping type during the e-commerce checkout process. It extends the base `TrackingEvent` class with the identifier 'select_shipping_type_home' and overrides the data method to categorize this event under the broader 'checkout' event name for analytics purposes. This allows the application to monitor and analyze user shipping preference selections as part of the checkout funnel tracking.
