## Summary
This class defines a tracking event specifically for when a user selects pickup as their shipping method during the e-commerce checkout process. It extends the base `TrackingEvent` class with the identifier 'select_shipping_type_pickup' and overrides the data output to categorize this action under the 'checkout' event name for analytics purposes. This enables the application to monitor and analyze customer preferences for pickup delivery options as part of the checkout funnel tracking.
