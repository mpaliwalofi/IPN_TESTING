## Summary
This class defines a tracking event specifically for capturing when a user upgrades their purchase to a subscription model in an e-commerce cart. It extends the base `TrackingEvent` class with the event type 'upgrade_to_subscription' and enriches the tracking data with cart-specific metadata (event name, action as 'Click', and location as 'Cart') for analytics purposes.
