## Summary
This class implements a Google Tag Manager tracking event specifically for the "view_item" e-commerce event that fires when a user views a product details page. It transforms product data (including SKU, title, price, ratings, reviews, and classifications) into the standardized GTM ecommerce data layer format, enriching it with source/list information to track where the user came from before viewing the product.
