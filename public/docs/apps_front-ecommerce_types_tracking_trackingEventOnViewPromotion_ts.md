## Summary
This class defines a tracking event for monitoring promotional content views in an e-commerce application. It extends a base `TrackingEvent` class to capture promotion details (name, location, and optional Pixie ad tracking data) and formats them into a structured analytics payload with ecommerce-specific metadata like creative slots, promotion IDs, and formatted promotion names for analytics platforms.
