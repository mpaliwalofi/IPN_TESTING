**Path**: `apps\front-ecommerce\vitest.config.ts`

## Summary
This is a Vitest configuration file for the front-ecommerce app that extends a base test configuration with Vue-specific testing capabilities. It configures auto-imports for composables and components from both the nuxt-ecommerce module and the local app, sets up SVG loading, and defines path aliases to resolve module dependencies during test execution. The configuration enables seamless testing of Vue/Nuxt components by automatically importing dependencies and establishing consistent path resolution across the monorepo structure.
