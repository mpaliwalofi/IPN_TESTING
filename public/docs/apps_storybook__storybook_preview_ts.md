## Summary
This file configures the Storybook preview environment for a Vue 3 e-commerce application by setting up essential plugins, dependencies, and global configurations needed to render components in isolation. It initializes internationalization (i18n) with French locales, routing, state management (Pinia), markdown rendering, and registers multiple design system plugins (accordion, carousel, smart image/link, etc.) along with mock implementations for Nuxt-specific functionality. The configuration ensures that components can be properly tested and showcased in Storybook with all their required dependencies and context providers available.
