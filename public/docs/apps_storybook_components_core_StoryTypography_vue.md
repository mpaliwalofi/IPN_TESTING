## Summary
This Vue component serves as a Storybook documentation page that visually demonstrates the typography system used throughout the application. It displays a comprehensive reference grid showing all available text sizes (from 2xs/10px to 12xl/88px) and heading styles (H1-H4), allowing developers and designers to preview and select appropriate typography classes for their UI components. The component acts as a living style guide for consistent text styling across the application.
