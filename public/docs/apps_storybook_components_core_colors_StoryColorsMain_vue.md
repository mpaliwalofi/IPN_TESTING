## Summary
This Vue component serves as a Storybook documentation page that displays the application's main color palette system. It visually showcases primary and secondary colors along with their various lightened and darkened variants (lighten-10/20/30 and darken-10/20/30), presenting each color swatch with labels in a responsive grid layout. The component acts as a design system reference for developers to see all available color utilities and their visual appearance.
