# useAddress.ts

**Path**: `apps\storybook\composables\useAddress.ts`

## Summary
This composable provides mock address data for Storybook component development and testing. It exports a `useAddress` function that returns hardcoded French address entries (with details like name, street, city, postal code, phone numbers) simulating an address book API response. The mock data allows UI components that display or manage user addresses to be developed and visually tested in isolation without requiring actual backend API calls.
