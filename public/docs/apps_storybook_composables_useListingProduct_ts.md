# useListingProduct.ts

**Path**: `apps\storybook\composables\useListingProduct.ts`

## Summary
This composable function manages product listing state for a Storybook component, accepting product metadata, filters, sorting options, and recommendations as inputs. It returns a reactive object containing the active filters, sort order, and product metadata for display, though the current implementation appears to be a stub or mock since it doesn't perform actual filtering or sorting operations. The function serves as a state management layer for product listing UI components in the Storybook development environment.
