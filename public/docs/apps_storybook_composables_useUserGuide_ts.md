**Path**: `apps\storybook\composables\useUserGuide.ts`

## Summary
This composable provides mock data for a user guide feature in a Storybook environment, returning hardcoded options for animal-related form fields. It supplies sample data for animal types (dog/cat), genders (male/female), and breeds with their associated metadata like icons, IDs, and API references. The function serves as a development/testing utility to simulate API responses without requiring actual backend calls in the Storybook UI component library.
