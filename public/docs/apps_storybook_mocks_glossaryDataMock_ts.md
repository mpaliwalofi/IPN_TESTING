## Summary
This file exports mock data for a glossary feature related to pet food product attributes. It contains structured entries with nutritional information (like animal proteins and fish content), images, and descriptions in French that explain ingredient benefits for dogs and cats. The mock data follows a CMS-like structure with metadata for images hosted on ImageKit, likely used for Storybook component development and testing of glossary UI components.
