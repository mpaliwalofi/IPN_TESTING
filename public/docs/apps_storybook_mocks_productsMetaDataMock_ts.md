## Summary
This TypeScript file exports mock data for a product catalog, specifically containing pet food products (cat and dog food) with detailed metadata including SKUs, pricing, variants, images, reviews, and product classifications. The mock data is structured to simulate a complete product listing system with attributes like stock status, subscription pricing, product filters, and localized content, likely used for Storybook component testing and development of an e-commerce pet food platform.
