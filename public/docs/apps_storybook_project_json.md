# project.json

**Path**: `apps\storybook\project.json`

## Summary
This is an Nx project configuration file for a Storybook application within a monorepo. It defines the project metadata including its name, source root location, and project type (library), but notably has an empty targets configuration, suggesting build and serve commands may be defined elsewhere or inherited from workspace-level configurations. The file serves as the project registry entry for Nx's dependency graph and task orchestration system.
