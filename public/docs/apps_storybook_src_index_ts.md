# index.ts

**Path**: `apps\storybook\src\index.ts`

## Summary
This file serves as the entry point for a Storybook application, which is a development environment for UI components. It appears to be currently empty or only contains basic initialization/re-export code, acting as the main index file that would typically configure and launch the Storybook instance for component development and testing in isolation.
