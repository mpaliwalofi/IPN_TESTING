## Summary
This TypeScript declaration file provides type definitions for importing Vue single-file components (`.vue` files) in a TypeScript environment. It tells the TypeScript compiler that any `.vue` file import should be treated as a Vue component created by `defineComponent`, enabling proper type checking and IntelliSense support for Vue components within the Storybook application.
