## Summary
This Storybook documentation file provides a status tracking dashboard for UI components in a Core/Module component library, displaying the completion state of Nuxt 3 implementation, tests, and Storybook stories for each component. It serves as a centralized reference for developers to quickly assess which components (like AccordionFold, Buttons, Carousel, etc.) are production-ready versus still in development, using a visual table format with checkmarks and status indicators.
