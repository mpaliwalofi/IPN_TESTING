## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file that defines visual test stories for an e-commerce header component (`TheHeader.vue`). It creates three story variants—Default (with light menu), Legacy (with legacy menu), and Logged (authenticated user state)—each configured to render across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports using Chromatic for visual regression testing. The stories mock runtime configuration and customer store state to demonstrate different header appearances based on feature flags and authentication status.
