## Summary
This is a Storybook documentation file that tracks the implementation status of e-commerce UI components across different categories (animal, cart, checkout, etc.). It serves as a progress dashboard using emoji indicators to show which components have completed their default implementations, variant implementations, and folder organization, helping the development team monitor component library completeness for an e-commerce application.
