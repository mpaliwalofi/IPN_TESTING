# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `apps\storybook\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for a Storybook application that serves as a project composition root. It uses TypeScript's project references feature to orchestrate multiple sub-configurations (lib, storybook, and spec) and references UI component packages (accordionFold and heading), enabling modular compilation and type-checking across the monorepo's documentation/component showcase system.
