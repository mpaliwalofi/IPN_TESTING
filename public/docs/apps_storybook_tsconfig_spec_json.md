**Path**: `apps\storybook\tsconfig.spec.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file specifically for test specifications in a Storybook application. It extends the base TypeScript config and configures the compiler to recognize Vitest testing framework types, include test files (*.test.* and *.spec.* files), and output compiled test files to a specific directory. The configuration ensures proper type checking and compilation settings for the testing environment within the Storybook monorepo application.
