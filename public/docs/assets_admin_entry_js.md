# entry.js

**Path**: `assets\admin\entry.js`

## Summary
This is the main entry point for the admin section's frontend assets in what appears to be a Sylius-based e-commerce application. It bundles and imports various JavaScript modules (international telephone input, cookie handling, form validation, autocomplete customization, and calendar functionality) along with the main SCSS stylesheet to provide enhanced UI/UX features for the admin panel.
