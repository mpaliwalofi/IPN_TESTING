**Path**: `assets\admin\js\fullcalendar.js`

## Summary
This code serves as a global configuration module for FullCalendar integration in an admin interface. It imports and exposes the FullCalendar library's core components, including the Calendar class, internationalization locales, Moment.js integration utilities, and the day grid view plugin. The module aggregates these dependencies into a single `global.fullcalendar` object, making them accessible throughout the application for rendering and managing calendar views with date/time functionality.
