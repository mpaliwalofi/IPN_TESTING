# jsCookie.js

**Path**: `assets\admin\js\jsCookie.js`

## Summary
This module imports the js-cookie library and exposes it globally by attaching it to the `global` object, making cookie management functionality available throughout the application without requiring repeated imports. It serves as a centralized entry point for client-side cookie operations (reading, writing, and deleting cookies) in the admin interface, ensuring consistent cookie handling across different JavaScript modules.
