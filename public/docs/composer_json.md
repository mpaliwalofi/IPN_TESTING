# composer.json

**Path**: `composer.json`

## Summary
This is a Composer configuration file for a Sylius-based eCommerce project that defines project metadata, dependencies, and build requirements. It specifies PHP 8.2+ as the runtime requirement along with numerous extensions and third-party packages for payment processing (PayPal, Payzen, Checkout), cloud services (Google Cloud BigQuery, PubSub, Storage), messaging, API functionality, and various Symfony/Sylius eCommerce features. The configuration serves as the dependency management manifest for a complete Sylius eCommerce application with integrated payment gateways, analytics, and cloud infrastructure support.
