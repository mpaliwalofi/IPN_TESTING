# AdminUserGroup.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\AdminUserGroup.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata properties for an AdminUserGroup resource. It specifies that the `id` property serves as the unique identifier for admin user group entities and is read-only (not writable), which is a common pattern for auto-generated primary keys in REST APIs managing administrative user groups.
