# AnimalActivityTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\AnimalActivityTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines the API resource properties for the `AnimalActivityTranslation` entity, which handles translations of animal activity data across different locales. It specifies that the `id` field is non-writable and not used as an identifier, while the `locale` field serves as the primary identifier and is required, enabling locale-based lookups for translated animal activity content.
