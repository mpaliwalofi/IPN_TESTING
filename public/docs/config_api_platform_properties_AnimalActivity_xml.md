# AnimalActivity.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\AnimalActivity.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform XML configuration file defines metadata for the AnimalActivity resource properties. It specifies that the `id` field serves as the primary identifier and that both `id` and `code` fields are read-only (not writable through the API), controlling how these properties are exposed and handled in API operations.
