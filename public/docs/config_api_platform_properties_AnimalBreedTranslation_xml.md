## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata properties for the AnimalBreedTranslation resource, specifying how translation entities are exposed through the API. It configures two key properties: the `id` field as non-writable and non-identifier, and the `locale` field as the primary identifier (required), enabling locale-based lookups for animal breed translations in a multilingual system.
