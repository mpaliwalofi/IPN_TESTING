# AnimalConditionTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\AnimalConditionTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines property metadata for the `AnimalConditionTranslation` resource, which handles translations of animal condition data across different locales. It specifies that the `id` field is non-writable and not used as an identifier, while the `locale` field serves as the primary identifier and is required, indicating this resource uses locale-based identification for managing multilingual animal condition descriptions.
