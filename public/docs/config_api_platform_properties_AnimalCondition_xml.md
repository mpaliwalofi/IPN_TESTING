# AnimalCondition.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\AnimalCondition.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines the metadata properties for an AnimalCondition resource in what appears to be an animal management system. It specifies that the `id` field serves as the read-only identifier and the `code` field is also non-writable, indicating these are system-managed properties that cannot be modified through the API once set.
