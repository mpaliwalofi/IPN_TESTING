# AnimalFeatureTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\AnimalFeatureTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata properties for the AnimalFeatureTranslation entity, which handles translations of animal features in different languages. It specifies that the `id` field is not an identifier and is read-only, while the `locale` field serves as the primary identifier and is required, indicating that translations are uniquely identified by their locale rather than by a numeric ID.
