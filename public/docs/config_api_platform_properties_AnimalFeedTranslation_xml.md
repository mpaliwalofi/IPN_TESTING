# AnimalFeedTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\AnimalFeedTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines the metadata properties for the AnimalFeedTranslation resource, which handles translations of animal feed data across different locales. It specifies that the `id` field is non-writable and not used as an identifier, while the `locale` field serves as the primary identifier and is required, indicating this resource uses locale-based routing for managing multilingual animal feed content.
