# AnimalFeed.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\AnimalFeed.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines API Platform metadata for the AnimalFeed resource entity. It specifies that the `id` property serves as the resource identifier and is read-only (not writable), which is a standard configuration for ensuring the primary key of an AnimalFeed entity cannot be modified through the API.
