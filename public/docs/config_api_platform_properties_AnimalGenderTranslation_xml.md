# AnimalGenderTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\AnimalGenderTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata properties for the `AnimalGenderTranslation` resource, which handles internationalization of animal gender terminology. It specifies that `locale` serves as the identifier (primary key) for translations, while `id` is non-writable and not used as an identifier, establishing a translatable entity pattern where each locale represents a different language version of an animal gender label.
