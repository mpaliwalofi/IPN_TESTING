**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\AnimalKibbleBrandRange.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata properties for an `AnimalKibbleBrandRange` resource entity in what appears to be a pet food/animal nutrition management system. It specifies that the `id` field serves as the identifier and both `id` and `code` fields are read-only (not writable through the API), likely representing a brand range or product line category for animal kibble products.
