# AnimalKibbleBrand.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\AnimalKibbleBrand.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines property-level metadata for an `AnimalKibbleBrand` resource in a pet food/animal care domain. It specifies that the `id` field serves as the read-only identifier and the `code` field is also read-only, controlling how these properties behave in API operations (preventing client modification during POST/PUT requests).
