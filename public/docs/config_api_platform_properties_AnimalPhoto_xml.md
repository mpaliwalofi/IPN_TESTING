# AnimalPhoto.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\AnimalPhoto.xml`

## Summary
This is an API Platform metadata configuration file that defines read-only property mappings for an AnimalPhoto resource entity. It specifies that all properties (id, animal reference, file metadata like fileId/fileName/hash, and timestamps) are non-writable through the API, indicating this resource is meant for display/retrieval only, with photo uploads and modifications likely handled through separate endpoints or internal processes.
