# AnimalTypeTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\AnimalTypeTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata properties for the `AnimalTypeTranslation` resource, which handles localized/translated versions of animal type names or descriptions. It specifies that the `id` field is non-writable and not used as an identifier, while the `locale` field serves as the primary identifier and is required, indicating that translations are uniquely identified by their language/locale code rather than a numeric ID.
