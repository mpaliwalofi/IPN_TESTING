# Animal.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\Animal.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata for the Animal resource entity. It specifies that the `code` field should be used as the primary identifier (instead of `id`) for API operations, and both `id` and `code` fields are marked as non-writable to prevent modification through the API.
