# OrderRuleCondition.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\OrderRuleCondition.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines property metadata for an OrderRuleCondition entity, specifically configuring the "id" property as a read-only identifier. It serves as part of the API resource configuration to control how the OrderRuleCondition's ID field is exposed and handled in API operations, ensuring it cannot be modified through API requests while serving as the primary identifier for the resource.
