# OrderRuleTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\OrderRuleTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines API Platform property metadata for the OrderRuleTranslation resource, specifically configuring its identifier properties. It specifies that the `locale` field serves as the identifier (rather than the default `id` field) for API operations, enabling translation records to be uniquely identified and accessed by their locale value in the API endpoints.
