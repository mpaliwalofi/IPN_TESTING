# OrderRule.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\OrderRule.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata properties for an OrderRule resource entity. It specifically configures the "id" property as the resource identifier, making it read-only (non-writable) for API operations, which is standard practice for auto-generated primary keys in REST APIs.
