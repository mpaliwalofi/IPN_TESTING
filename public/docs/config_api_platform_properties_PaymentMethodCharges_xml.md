## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata for the `PaymentMethodCharges` entity, specifically configuring its `id` property as the resource identifier that is read-only (non-writable). It establishes how the payment method charges entity should be exposed through the API, ensuring the ID field cannot be modified through API operations while serving as the unique identifier for the resource.
