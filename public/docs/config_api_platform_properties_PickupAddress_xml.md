# PickupAddress.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\PickupAddress.xml`

## Summary
This is an API Platform XML configuration file that defines the exposed properties and their access rules for a PickupAddress resource in what appears to be a shipping or logistics system. It specifies that three properties (id, pickupPoint, and externalReference) are read-only in the API, with 'id' serving as the resource identifier, ensuring these fields cannot be modified through API requests while still being accessible for retrieval.
