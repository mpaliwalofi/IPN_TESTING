## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata properties for the `PickupPointHasShippingMethod` entity, which represents the relationship between pickup points and their available shipping methods. It specifically configures the `id` property as a read-only identifier for this association entity, preventing external modification while allowing API exposure for identifying which shipping methods are available at specific pickup locations.
