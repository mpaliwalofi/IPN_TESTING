# PickupPoint.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\PickupPoint.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines the API exposure settings for a PickupPoint resource, making all properties read-only (writable="false") for the API. It designates `tokenValue` as the unique identifier instead of the traditional `id` field, and exposes properties related to pickup point details including location, photo, operating hours (openings), availability status, address, and associated shipping methods.
