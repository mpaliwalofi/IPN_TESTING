# PromotionAnalyticBroadcast.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\PromotionAnalyticBroadcast.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines property metadata for the `PromotionAnalyticBroadcast` entity, specifically marking its `id` field as the resource identifier that is read-only (not writable). It serves as part of the API Platform's declarative configuration to control how promotion analytics broadcast data is exposed and manipulated through the API, ensuring the ID cannot be modified via API requests.
