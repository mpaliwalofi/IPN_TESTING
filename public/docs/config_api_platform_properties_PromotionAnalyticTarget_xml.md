# PromotionAnalyticTarget.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\PromotionAnalyticTarget.xml`

## Summary
This is an API Platform XML configuration file that defines property metadata for the `PromotionAnalyticTarget` entity. It specifies that the `id` property serves as the resource identifier and is read-only (not writable), which establishes how this promotion analytics tracking entity is exposed through the API. This configuration enables API Platform to properly serialize/deserialize the entity while preventing external modification of its identifier field.
