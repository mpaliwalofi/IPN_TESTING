# PromotionCouponCustomer.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\PromotionCouponCustomer.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata properties for a PromotionCouponCustomer resource entity. It specifically configures the "id" field as the resource identifier, making it read-only (non-writable) for API operations, which is a standard practice for primary key fields in REST APIs.
