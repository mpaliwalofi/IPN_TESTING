# ShippingMethodCategoryTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\ShippingMethodCategoryTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines property metadata for the ShippingMethodCategoryTranslation resource, specifically configuring which fields serve as identifiers in the API. It establishes that the `locale` field (language/region code) acts as the primary identifier rather than the standard `id` field, which is typical for translation entities where the locale is the distinguishing factor for different language versions of shipping method category data.
