# ShippingMethodCategory.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\ShippingMethodCategory.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines property metadata for the ShippingMethodCategory resource. It specifies that the `id` field serves as the resource identifier and is read-only (not writable), which is a standard configuration for entity identifiers in REST APIs to prevent clients from modifying primary keys.
