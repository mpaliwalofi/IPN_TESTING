# ShippingRangePrice.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\ShippingRangePrice.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata properties for a `ShippingRangePrice` resource, specifically marking its `id` field as a non-writable identifier. The configuration is used by API Platform to automatically generate RESTful API endpoints for managing shipping price ranges, likely used in an e-commerce system to calculate shipping costs based on order ranges (weight, distance, or order value).
