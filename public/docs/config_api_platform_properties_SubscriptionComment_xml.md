# SubscriptionComment.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\SubscriptionComment.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines property-level metadata for a SubscriptionComment resource. It specifically configures the "id" property as the resource identifier that is read-only (not writable), which is a standard REST API pattern for entity identifiers that are auto-generated by the system rather than provided by API clients.
