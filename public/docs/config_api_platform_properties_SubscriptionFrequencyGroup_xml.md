# SubscriptionFrequencyGroup.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\SubscriptionFrequencyGroup.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata properties for a SubscriptionFrequencyGroup resource. It specifies that the `id` property serves as the resource identifier and is read-only (not writable), which is typical for auto-generated primary keys in subscription management systems where frequency groups likely categorize different billing or delivery intervals.
