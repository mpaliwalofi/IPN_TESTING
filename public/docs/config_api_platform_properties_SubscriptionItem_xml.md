# SubscriptionItem.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\SubscriptionItem.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines metadata properties for a SubscriptionItem resource entity. It specifies that the 'id' property should be used as the resource identifier and marked as read-only (non-writable), which is a standard configuration for primary keys in REST APIs to prevent clients from modifying resource identifiers.
