# SubscriptionStopReasonTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\SubscriptionStopReasonTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines property metadata for the SubscriptionStopReasonTranslation resource, specifying how translation entities for subscription cancellation reasons are exposed through the API. It configures the `id` field as non-writable and non-identifying, while setting `locale` as the primary identifier and required field, indicating that translations are accessed and managed by their language locale rather than by database ID.
