# SubscriptionStopReason.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\SubscriptionStopReason.xml`

It specifically configures the `id` property as the resource identifier and marks it as non-writable (read-only), which is standard for auto-generated database identifiers in a subscription management system.
