# Subscription.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\properties\Subscription.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines API Platform property metadata for a Subscription resource. It specifies that the `code` field serves as the primary identifier (instead of the default `id`), and marks both `id` and `code` as read-only (non-writable) properties in the API, ensuring these fields cannot be modified through API requests.
