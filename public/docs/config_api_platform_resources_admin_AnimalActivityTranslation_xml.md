# AnimalActivityTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\AnimalActivityTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines a REST API resource for managing translations of animal activities in an admin context. It configures a single "NotExposed" GET collection operation that retrieves translation data for a specific animal activity by its ID and locale code, using the URI pattern `/admin/animal-activities/{id}/translations/{localeCode}`. The configuration establishes the relationship between animal activities and their translations through URI variables, enabling multilingual support for animal activity content in the system.
