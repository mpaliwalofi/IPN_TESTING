# AnimalActivity.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\AnimalActivity.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for managing AnimalActivity resources in an admin context. It configures two operations: a GET collection endpoint (with pagination disabled, locale-based filtering, and priority-based ordering) and a POST endpoint (using a custom persistence processor), both using the `admin:animal_activity:read` serialization group for response normalization.
