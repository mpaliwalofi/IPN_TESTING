# AnimalConditionTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\AnimalConditionTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines a REST API resource for managing translations of animal condition entities in an admin context. It configures a single "NotExposed" operation that maps to the URI pattern `/admin/animal-conditions/{id}/translations/{localeCode}`, establishing the relationship between animal conditions and their localized translations through URI variables that link the translation entity to its parent animal condition.
