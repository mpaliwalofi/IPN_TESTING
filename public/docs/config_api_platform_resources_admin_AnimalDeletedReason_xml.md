# AnimalDeletedReason.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\AnimalDeletedReason.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for managing animal deletion reasons in an admin context. It configures two operations: a GET collection endpoint to retrieve all deletion reasons (with translation support, locale-based filtering, and priority-based ordering), and a POST endpoint to create new deletion reasons using a custom persistence processor. The configuration is part of a Sylius-based application that tracks reasons why animals are removed from the system.
