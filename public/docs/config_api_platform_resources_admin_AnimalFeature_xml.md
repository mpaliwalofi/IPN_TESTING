# AnimalFeature.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\AnimalFeature.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines an API Platform resource for managing animal features in an admin context. It specifies two REST API operations: a GET collection endpoint that retrieves all animal features (with pagination disabled, filtered and ordered by priority), and a POST endpoint for creating new animal features, both using normalization/denormalization groups for controlling data serialization in admin contexts.
