# AnimalFeed.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\AnimalFeed.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform XML configuration file defines admin-level REST API endpoints for managing AnimalFeed resources in what appears to be a Sylius-based application. It configures two operations: a GET collection endpoint (with locale-based filtering, priority-based ordering, and disabled pagination) and a POST endpoint for creating new animal feed entries, both using serialization groups for controlling data exposure in admin contexts.
