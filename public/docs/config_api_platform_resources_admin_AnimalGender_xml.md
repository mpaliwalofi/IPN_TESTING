# AnimalGender.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\AnimalGender.xml`

## Summary
This is an API Platform configuration file that defines REST API endpoints for managing animal gender resources in an admin context. It configures two operations: a GET collection endpoint (with pagination disabled, locale-based filtering, and priority-based ordering) and a POST endpoint for creating new animal gender entries, both using specific serialization groups for reading and writing data in the admin interface.
