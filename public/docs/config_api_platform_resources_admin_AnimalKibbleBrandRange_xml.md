# AnimalKibbleBrandRange.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\AnimalKibbleBrandRange.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines RESTful API endpoints for managing Animal Kibble Brand Range resources in an admin context. It configures two operations: a GET collection endpoint that retrieves all brand ranges sorted by priority (with pagination disabled), and a POST endpoint for creating new brand ranges using a custom persistence processor. The configuration specifies serialization groups for controlling data exposure and uses the Sylius e-commerce framework conventions for routing and naming.
