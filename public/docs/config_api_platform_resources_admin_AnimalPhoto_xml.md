# AnimalPhoto.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\AnimalPhoto.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines admin-level API endpoints for managing AnimalPhoto resources in a Sylius-based application. It configures two read-only operations: a collection endpoint that retrieves all animal photos sorted by priority in descending order (with pagination disabled), and a single item endpoint for fetching individual animal photos, both using the `admin:animal_photo:read` serialization group for data normalization.
