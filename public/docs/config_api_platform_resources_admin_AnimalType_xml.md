# AnimalType.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\AnimalType.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for managing AnimalType resources in an admin context. It configures two operations: a GET collection endpoint that retrieves all animal types (with pagination disabled, locale-based filtering, and priority-based ordering), and a POST endpoint for creating new animal types, both using specific serialization groups for access control and data transformation.
