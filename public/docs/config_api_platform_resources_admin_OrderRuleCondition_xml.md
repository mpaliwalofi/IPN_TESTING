# OrderRuleCondition.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\OrderRuleCondition.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines read-only REST API endpoints for the OrderRuleCondition resource in the admin context. It specifies two operations: retrieving a collection of order rule conditions (GET collection) and fetching a single order rule condition (GET), both using the `admin:order_rule:read` serialization group for data normalization. The configuration is part of a Sylius-based e-commerce system's admin API for managing order-related business rules and their conditions.
