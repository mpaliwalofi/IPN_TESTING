# OrderRuleTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\OrderRuleTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines a REST API resource for managing OrderRuleTranslation entities in an admin context. It exposes a single operation with URI template `/admin/order-rules/{id}/translations/{localeCode}` that is marked as "NotExposed", meaning it's configured but not actually accessible via the API, likely serving as a placeholder or for internal routing purposes while allowing navigation between OrderRule entities and their localized translations.
