# OrderRule.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\OrderRule.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for managing OrderRule resources in a Sylius e-commerce admin interface. It configures three operations: retrieving a collection of order rules (GET collection), retrieving a single order rule (GET), and creating new order rules (POST), with specific serialization groups controlling which fields are exposed for read and write operations in the admin context.
