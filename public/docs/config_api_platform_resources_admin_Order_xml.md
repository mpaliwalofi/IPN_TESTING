# Order.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\Order.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines custom API Platform operations for Order management in a Sylius e-commerce admin panel. It configures three GET endpoints: one for retrieving webmethod-specific order representations, another for checking payment states of order payments, and a third for generating order invoices. These endpoints extend the standard Sylius admin API with application-specific functionality for order processing and payment tracking.
