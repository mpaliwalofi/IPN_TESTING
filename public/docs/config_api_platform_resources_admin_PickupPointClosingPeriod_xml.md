# PickupPointClosingPeriod.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\PickupPointClosingPeriod.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines admin-level API endpoints for managing pickup point closing periods in a Sylius e-commerce application. It exposes two read-only operations: retrieving a collection of closing periods and fetching individual closing period details, both using the `admin:pickup_point:read` serialization group for controlled data access.
