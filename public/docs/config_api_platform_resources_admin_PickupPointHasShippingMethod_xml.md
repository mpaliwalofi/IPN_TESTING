# PickupPointHasShippingMethod.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\PickupPointHasShippingMethod.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines read-only admin API endpoints for the `PickupPointHasShippingMethod` entity, which represents the relationship between pickup points and shipping methods in a Sylius e-commerce system. It exposes two operations: retrieving a collection of pickup point-shipping method associations and fetching individual associations, both using the `admin:pickup_point:read` serialization group for controlling data exposure to admin users.
