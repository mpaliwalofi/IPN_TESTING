# PromotionAnalyticBroadcast.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\PromotionAnalyticBroadcast.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines read-only admin API endpoints for the `PromotionAnalyticBroadcast` entity in a Sylius e-commerce system. It exposes two operations: a collection retrieval endpoint (GET collection) and a single item retrieval endpoint (GET), both using the `sylius:admin:promotion:show` serialization group to control which data fields are returned. The configuration enables administrators to access promotion analytics broadcast data through the API without modification capabilities.
