# PromotionAnalyticTarget.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\PromotionAnalyticTarget.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines read-only REST API endpoints for the `PromotionAnalyticTarget` entity in the admin context. It exposes two operations: retrieving a collection of promotion analytic targets and fetching individual targets, both using the `sylius:admin:promotion:show` serialization group for response formatting. The configuration enables administrators to query promotion analytics tracking data through standardized API endpoints.
