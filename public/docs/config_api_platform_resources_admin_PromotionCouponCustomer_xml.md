# PromotionCouponCustomer.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\PromotionCouponCustomer.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for managing the relationship between promotion coupons and customers in a Sylius e-commerce admin interface. It exposes two read-only operations (GetCollection and Get) that allow administrators to retrieve coupon-customer associations with specific serialization groups for displaying related order, customer, and promotion coupon data. The configuration uses the `admin` route prefix to restrict these endpoints to administrative access only.
