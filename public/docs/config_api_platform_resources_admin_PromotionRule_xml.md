# PromotionRule.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\PromotionRule.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for managing promotion rules in the Sylius e-commerce platform's admin interface. It specifies three operations: retrieving a collection of promotion rules (GET collection), fetching a single promotion rule (GET), and creating new promotion rules (POST), each with appropriate serialization groups for controlling data exposure and input validation. The configuration enables administrators to view and create business rules that determine when promotions should be applied to orders or products.
