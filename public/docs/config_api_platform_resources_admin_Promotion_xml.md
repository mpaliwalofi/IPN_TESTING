# Promotion.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\Promotion.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines custom admin operations for the Promotion resource in a Sylius e-commerce application. It configures two specialized endpoints: a delete operation with custom validation and processing, and a force-sync operation that triggers synchronization of promotions with an external "Webmethod" system via a messenger command. The configuration extends the base Sylius promotion functionality with application-specific administrative capabilities for managing promotional campaigns and their integration with external services.
