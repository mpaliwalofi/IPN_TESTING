# ShippingMethodCategoryTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\ShippingMethodCategoryTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines a REST API resource for managing shipping method category translations in a Sylius-based e-commerce admin panel. It exposes a single operation (`NotExposed` class indicates it's defined but not publicly accessible) that retrieves translations for a specific shipping method category using both the category ID and locale code as URI parameters. The configuration enables multi-language support for shipping method category content in the admin interface.
