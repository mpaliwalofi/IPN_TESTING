# ShippingMethodCategory.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\ShippingMethodCategory.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for managing shipping method categories in the admin section of a Sylius e-commerce application. It configures three operations: GET collection (list all categories), GET single item (retrieve one category), and POST (create new category), each with specific serialization groups for controlling data exposure and input validation. The configuration uses XML-based resource mapping to expose CRUD operations on the shipping method category model with admin-prefixed routes.
