# ShippingMethodRule.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\ShippingMethodRule.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API operations for managing shipping method rules in the Sylius e-commerce admin panel. It specifies three operations: retrieving a collection of shipping rules, getting a single rule, and creating new rules, each with their respective serialization groups for controlling data exposure. The configuration enables administrators to define and manage conditional rules that determine when specific shipping methods are available to customers.
