# ShippingRangePriceItem.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\ShippingRangePriceItem.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for managing shipping range price items in the admin context of a Sylius e-commerce application. It configures two read-only operations: a GET collection endpoint to list shipping range price items and a GET single item endpoint to retrieve individual shipping range price details, both using specific serialization groups for controlling the data exposed to administrators.
