# ShippingRangePrice.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\ShippingRangePrice.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for managing shipping range prices in the admin area of a Sylius e-commerce application. It configures two read-only operations: a GET collection endpoint to list shipping range prices and a GET endpoint to retrieve individual shipping range price details, both using specific serialization groups for controlling the data returned in admin contexts.
