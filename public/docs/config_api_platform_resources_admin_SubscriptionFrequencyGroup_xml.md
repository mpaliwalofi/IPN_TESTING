# SubscriptionFrequencyGroup.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\SubscriptionFrequencyGroup.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines read-only admin API endpoints for managing subscription frequency groups in what appears to be a Sylius-based e-commerce system. It configures two operations: a collection GET endpoint (to retrieve multiple frequency groups) with a custom state provider, and a single item GET endpoint (to retrieve one frequency group), both using the `admin:subscription_frequency_group:read` serialization group and prefixed with `/admin` in the routing.
