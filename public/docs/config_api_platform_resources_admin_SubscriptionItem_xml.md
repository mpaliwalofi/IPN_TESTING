# SubscriptionItem.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\SubscriptionItem.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines read-only admin API endpoints for subscription item resources in a Sylius e-commerce application. It exposes two operations: getting a collection of subscription items and retrieving a single subscription item, both using the `admin:subscription:read` serialization group for controlling which data fields are returned to administrators.
