# SubscriptionMonitoring.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\SubscriptionMonitoring.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines API Platform resources for an admin subscription monitoring feature in a Sylius-based application. It configures RESTful API operations (GET collection, GET single item, and PATCH) with specific serialization groups for reading and updating subscription monitoring data. The configuration uses a custom state provider for collection retrieval and enforces role-based access control by prefixing all routes with "admin".
