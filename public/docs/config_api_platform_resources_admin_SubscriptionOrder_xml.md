# SubscriptionOrder.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\SubscriptionOrder.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines admin-level API endpoints for managing subscription orders in what appears to be a Sylius e-commerce application. It configures two bulk operations: one for updating next shipping dates for multiple subscription orders (`bulk-update-next-shipping`) and another for processing bulk debit transactions (`bulk-debit`), both using POST methods with custom controllers and specific denormalization groups for admin access control.
