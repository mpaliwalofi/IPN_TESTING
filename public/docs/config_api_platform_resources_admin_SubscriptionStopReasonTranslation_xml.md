# SubscriptionStopReasonTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\SubscriptionStopReasonTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines a resource endpoint for managing translations of subscription stop reasons in an admin context. It exposes a `NotExposed` operation (meaning it's defined but not publicly accessible) at `/admin/subscription-stop-reasons/{id}/translations/{localeCode}` that retrieves translation data for a specific subscription stop reason in a given locale, supporting internationalization of subscription cancellation reasons in the application.
