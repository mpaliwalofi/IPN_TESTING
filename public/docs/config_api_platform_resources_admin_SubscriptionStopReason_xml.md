# SubscriptionStopReason.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\SubscriptionStopReason.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for managing subscription stop reasons in an admin context. It configures three operations: retrieving a collection of stop reasons (with translatable name/locale filtering), getting individual stop reasons, and creating new stop reasons, all using normalized/denormalized data groups for serialization control.
