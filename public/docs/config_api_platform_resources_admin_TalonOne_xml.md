# TalonOne.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\TalonOne.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines admin-level REST API endpoints for integrating with TalonOne, a promotional campaign and coupon management system. It exposes two main resources: campaigns (with list and detail operations) and customer-specific coupons (with a collection endpoint), all prefixed under the `/admin/talon_one/` route, allowing administrators to retrieve campaign information and manage customer coupon data through the TalonOne integration.
