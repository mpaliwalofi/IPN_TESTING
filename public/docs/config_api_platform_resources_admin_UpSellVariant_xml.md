# UpSellVariant.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\UpSellVariant.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for managing product upsell variants in a Sylius e-commerce admin interface. It configures two operations: a GET collection endpoint to retrieve upsell variants (ordered by position) and a POST endpoint to create new upsell variants, with appropriate serialization groups for reading and creating data in the admin context.
