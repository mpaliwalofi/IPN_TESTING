# UpSell.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\admin\UpSell.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for managing UpSell resources in an admin context. It configures two operations: a GET collection endpoint (`/admin/upsells`) that retrieves upsell items with filtering capabilities and ordering by position, and a POST endpoint for creating new upsell records. The configuration specifies serialization groups for controlling data exposure and uses a custom state provider for the collection retrieval.
