# Address.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\shop\Address.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines API Platform resources for managing customer addresses in a Sylius e-commerce shop context. It configures two REST API operations: a DELETE endpoint (`/shop/addresses/{id}`) for removing addresses and a POST endpoint (`/shop/addresses`) for creating new addresses, each with custom state processors and specific serialization/validation groups for controlling data flow and validation rules.
