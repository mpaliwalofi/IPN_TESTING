# AnimalActivity.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\shop\AnimalActivity.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for the `AnimalActivity` resource in a shop context. It configures two operations: a GET collection endpoint that retrieves all animal activities (sorted by priority in descending order, without pagination) and a GET single item endpoint, both using the `shop:activity:read` serialization group for controlling data exposure to shop customers.
