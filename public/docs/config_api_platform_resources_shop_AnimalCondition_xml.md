# AnimalCondition.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\shop\AnimalCondition.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for the AnimalCondition resource in a shop context. It exposes two read-only operations: a collection endpoint (GET all animal conditions, sorted by priority descending with pagination disabled) and a single item endpoint (GET one animal condition by ID), both using the "shop:animal_condition:read" serialization group for data normalization.
