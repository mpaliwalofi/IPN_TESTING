# AnimalFeature.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\shop\AnimalFeature.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for the AnimalFeature resource in a Sylius shop context. It exposes two read-only operations: a GET collection endpoint that returns all animal features sorted by priority in descending order without pagination, and a GET single item endpoint, both using specific normalization groups for controlling serialized output data.
