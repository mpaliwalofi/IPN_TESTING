# AnimalFeed.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\shop\AnimalFeed.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for the AnimalFeed resource within a shop context, specifically for read-only operations. It configures two endpoints: a GET collection endpoint (with pagination disabled and results ordered by priority descending) and a GET single item endpoint, both using the `shop:animal:feed:read` serialization group for controlling data exposure to shop customers.
