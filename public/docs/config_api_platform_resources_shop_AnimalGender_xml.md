# AnimalGender.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\shop\AnimalGender.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for the AnimalGender resource in a shop context. It exposes two read-only operations: a GET collection endpoint (with pagination disabled and ordered by priority descending) and a single item GET endpoint, both using the `shop:animal:gender:read` serialization group for controlling data exposure to shop customers.
