# AnimalPhoto.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\shop\AnimalPhoto.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines a REST API resource for retrieving animal photos in a shop context, likely part of a Sylius e-commerce application. It configures a single GET endpoint at `/shop/animal-photos/{id}` that returns animal photo data serialized with the `shop:animal_photos:read` normalization group, enabling customers to view individual animal photos through the shop's API.
