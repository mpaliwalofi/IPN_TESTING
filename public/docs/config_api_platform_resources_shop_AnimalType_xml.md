# AnimalType.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\shop\AnimalType.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for the AnimalType resource in a Sylius shop context. It exposes two read-only operations: a GET collection endpoint (with pagination disabled and results ordered by priority descending) and a GET single item endpoint, both using the `shop:animal:type:read` serialization group for controlling data exposure to shop customers.
