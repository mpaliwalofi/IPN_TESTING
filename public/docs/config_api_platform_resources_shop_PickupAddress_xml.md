# PickupAddress.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\shop\PickupAddress.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform resource configuration defines a read-only shop endpoint for pickup addresses in what appears to be a Sylius e-commerce application. It configures a single GET operation at `/shop/pickup-address/{id}` that retrieves individual pickup address details using the `shop:pickup_address:read` serialization group for controlling which fields are exposed to shop customers.
