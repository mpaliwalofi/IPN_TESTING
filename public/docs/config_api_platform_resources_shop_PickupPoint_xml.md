# PickupPoint.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\shop\PickupPoint.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform resource configuration defines REST API endpoints for retrieving pickup point locations in a shop context. It configures two GET collection operations: one for fetching available pickup points associated with a specific order (via order token), and another for pickup points related to a subscription (via subscription code). Both endpoints use a custom collection provider and support filtering by point criteria and shipping method to help customers select where to collect their orders or subscription deliveries.
