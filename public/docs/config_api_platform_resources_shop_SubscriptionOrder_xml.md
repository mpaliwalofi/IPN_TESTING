# SubscriptionOrder.xml

**Path**: `config\api_platform\resources\shop\SubscriptionOrder.xml`

## Summary
This API Platform configuration file defines REST API endpoints for managing subscription orders in an e-commerce shop context. It specifies two operations: a GET endpoint to retrieve subscription order details by token value (using cart display serialization groups), and a PATCH endpoint to update shipping information for subscription orders (using a command-based messenger pattern). The configuration is part of a Sylius-based application's shop API, handling the presentation and modification of recurring subscription order data.
