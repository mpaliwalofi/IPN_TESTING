# _hooks.yaml

**Path**: `config\behat\_hooks.yaml`

## Summary
This is a Symfony service configuration file for Behat testing hooks that currently only defines default service settings (making all services public). The commented-out section shows it's intended to configure Doctrine ORM hooks for Behat tests, specifically for managing database state during test execution, though this functionality is currently disabled.
