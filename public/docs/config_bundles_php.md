# bundles.php

**Path**: `config\bundles.php`

## Summary
This Symfony configuration file registers and enables all the application bundles (plugins/modules) across all environments. It primarily configures a Sylius e-commerce application by activating core Symfony bundles (Framework, Security, Doctrine, Twig) alongside numerous Sylius-specific bundles that handle e-commerce functionality like orders, products, payments, shipping, inventory, promotions, and customer management.
