# localizer.js

**Path**: `config\localizer.js`

## Summary
This configuration module exports localization and database settings for a Strapi CMS localizer feature. It retrieves environment variables to control localization behavior (enable/disable, locale selection, target configuration) and database connection parameters (host, credentials, database name). The configuration serves as a centralized setup for the Strapi localizer plugin, allowing content to be translated or adapted across different locales while specifying the necessary database access for the operation.
