# api_platform.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\api_platform.yaml`

## Summary
This is an API Platform configuration file that sets up REST and GraphQL API behavior for a Symfony application. It defines resource mapping paths across entities, DTOs, and views, configures pagination defaults to allow client-controlled items per page, and enables Swagger/OpenAPI 3 documentation. The configuration also optimizes eager loading with a maximum of 100 joins and disables the default GraphQL IDE interface.
