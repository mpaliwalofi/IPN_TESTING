# assets.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\assets.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file enables Symfony's asset management component, which handles the processing and serving of web assets like CSS, JavaScript, images, and fonts. It provides features such as asset versioning, URL generation, and integration with Webpack Encore for frontend asset compilation. The file currently contains only the minimal configuration needed to activate the assets system with default settings.
