**Path**: `config\packages\dev\doctrine.yaml`

## Summary
This Symfony development environment configuration file defines Doctrine DBAL database connection settings for MySQL. It configures the default database connection using environment variables for credentials and connection details (host, port, database name), sets MySQL 8.0 as the server version, and maps custom MySQL types (enum and point) to Doctrine types for proper ORM handling.
