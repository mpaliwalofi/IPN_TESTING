# routing.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\dev\routing.yaml`

## Summary
This Symfony configuration file enables strict routing requirements validation in the development environment. When enabled, it ensures that route parameters strictly match their defined requirements (regex patterns), throwing exceptions for mismatches rather than silently failing, which helps developers catch routing configuration errors early during development.
