**Path**: `config\packages\dev\sylius_pay_pal.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file enables PayPal sandbox mode for development environments in a Sylius e-commerce application. By setting `sandbox: true`, it configures the PayPal payment integration to use PayPal's test environment rather than the live production environment, allowing developers to test payment workflows without processing real transactions.
