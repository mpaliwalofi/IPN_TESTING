# dh_auditor.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\dh_auditor.yaml`

## Summary
This YAML configuration file sets up the DH Auditor bundle for Symfony, which provides database audit trail functionality by tracking changes to Doctrine entities. It configures audit logging with timezone settings, role/user/security information providers, and specifies that Doctrine entities should be audited using the default entity manager with audit tables having a '_audit' suffix. The configuration enables an audit viewer for inspecting historical changes to database records.
