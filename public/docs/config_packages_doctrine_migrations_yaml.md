# doctrine_migrations.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\doctrine_migrations.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file sets up Doctrine Migrations for a Sylius e-commerce application. It defines that migration version history will be stored in a custom table named `sylius_migrations` and maps two migration namespaces (DoctrineMigrations and Sylius CoreBundle migrations) to the project's `/migrations` directory, allowing the application to track and execute database schema changes.
