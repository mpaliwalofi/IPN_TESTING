# doctrine.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\doctrine.yaml`

## Summary
This Doctrine configuration file sets up database connectivity and ORM behavior for a Symfony application using MySQL. It defines database connection parameters (host, port, credentials) with environment variable fallbacks, configures a custom spatial data type (point) for geographic coordinates, and registers custom DQL functions for date manipulation, JSON operations, and spatial distance calculations. The configuration enables the application to work with geographic data and perform advanced database queries including spatial operations like distance calculations between points.
