# customer.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\fixtures\main\customer.yaml`

## Summary
This YAML configuration file defines Sylius fixture data for development environments, specifically creating test customer accounts and their associated addresses. It sets up four shop users (John Doe, Marc Swan, Kim Down, and Thomas Shelby) with email addresses, passwords, and phone numbers all assigned to the 'fr' channel, along with at least one address record for the John Doe customer. This fixture data is used to populate the database with sample customers for testing and development purposes in a Sylius e-commerce application.
