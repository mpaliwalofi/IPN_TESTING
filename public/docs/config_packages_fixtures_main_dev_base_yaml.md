# dev_base.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\fixtures\main\dev_base.yaml`

## Summary
This YAML configuration file defines fixture loading settings for development and test environments in a Sylius-based application. It specifies two fixtures (`holiday` and `subscription_monitoring`) with priority 9 that should be loaded in the "main" suite, using YAML anchors to ensure identical configuration across both dev and test environments. The fixtures appear to seed data related to holiday schedules and subscription monitoring functionality for testing and development purposes.
