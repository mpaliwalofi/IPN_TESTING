# order.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\fixtures\main\order.yaml`

## Summary
This YAML configuration file defines test fixtures for the Sylius e-commerce framework, specifically creating sample subscription orders for testing purposes. It configures four historical subscription orders for a French customer (johndoe@example.com) with varying frequencies (31 and 77 days), all using the PAYZEN payment method and sharing the same subscription token. These fixtures are used to populate the database with realistic order data for development, testing, or demonstration environments.
