**Path**: `config\packages\fixtures\main\pickup_point.yaml`

## Summary
This YAML configuration file defines fixture data for pickup points in a Sylius e-commerce application. It configures a sample pickup point location (CASH EXPRESS in Bordeaux, France) with complete details including geographic coordinates, business hours for each day of the week, address information, and association with a specific shipping method (Mondial Relay). The fixture is used to populate the database with test or initial pickup point data for development or demonstration purposes.
