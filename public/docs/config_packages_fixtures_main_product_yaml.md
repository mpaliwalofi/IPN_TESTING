# product.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\fixtures\main\product.yaml`

## Summary
This YAML configuration file defines Sylius e-commerce fixtures for product-related test data in the development environment. It sets up product attributes (like a checkbox for sample products), product options (like dog food formats in 4kg/12kg sizes), and actual product definitions (such as grain-free dog kibble with specific codes, tax categories, and subscription capabilities). The fixtures are used to populate the database with realistic product catalog data for development and testing purposes.
