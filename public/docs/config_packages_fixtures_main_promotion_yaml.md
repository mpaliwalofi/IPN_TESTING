# promotion.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\fixtures\main\promotion.yaml`

## Summary
This YAML configuration file defines Sylius e-commerce promotion fixtures for the development environment. It configures two promotional campaigns: "GIFTPRODUCT" (a coupon-based promotion that adds a discounted product when cart total exceeds €40) and "Gobelet offert" (a first-order promotion that discounts a specific product variant). The fixtures are used to populate the database with test promotion data during development, with priority 8 in the loading sequence.
