# shipping_zones.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\fixtures\main\shipping_zones.yaml`

## Summary
This YAML configuration file defines Sylius fixture data for shipping zones in France, specifically creating zone-based shipping restrictions. It establishes two custom shipping zones: one for Corsica (postal codes 20000-20999) and another for hard-to-reach areas serviced by Chronopost but not TNT (specific postal codes like 02160, 02168, etc.), enabling differentiated shipping logic based on geographic accessibility.
