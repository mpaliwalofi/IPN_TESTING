# fixtures.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\fixtures.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file defines Sylius fixture suites for loading test or initial data into the application. Specifically, it imports a main fixtures configuration and defines a "pre_migrate" suite that creates a disabled legacy payment method for the default channel, likely used to maintain backward compatibility or test migration scenarios before database migrations run.
