## Summary
This Symfony framework configuration file defines core application security and behavior settings. It configures essential features including form handling, CSRF protection, trusted proxy settings for load balancers (10.0.0.0/8 network), session management with 24-hour cookie lifetime, and serializer mapping paths. The configuration establishes foundational security policies and runtime behavior for the Symfony application, including error logging, secure cookie settings, and proxy header trust rules for deployment behind reverse proxies.
