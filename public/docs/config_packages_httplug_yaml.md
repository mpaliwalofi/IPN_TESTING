# httplug.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\httplug.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file sets up the HTTPlug HTTP client library for a Symfony application. It configures automatic client discovery, enables retry logic with 1 retry attempt, and defines an 'app' client with content-length calculation and redirect-following plugins enabled. The configuration ensures HTTP requests have proper headers and automatically handle redirects when communicating with external APIs or services.
