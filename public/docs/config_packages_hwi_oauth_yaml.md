# hwi_oauth.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\hwi_oauth.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file sets up OAuth authentication using the HWI OAuth Bundle for Symfony, specifically enabling Google Single Sign-On (SSO) for the admin firewall. It configures Google as the OAuth resource owner with credentials pulled from environment variables, requests email and profile scopes, uses email as the user identifier, and sets OAuth options for offline access with consent prompt to enable token refresh capabilities.
