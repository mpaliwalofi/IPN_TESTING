**Path**: `config\packages\nelmio_cors.yaml`

## Summary
This CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration file defines which external domains are permitted to make API requests to the UltraPremiumDirect application. It whitelists multiple domain patterns including local development environments, production domains across different TLDs (.com, .pro, .be, .nl), and staging environments, while specifying allowed HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, etc.) and headers for cross-origin requests. The configuration ensures secure API access from authorized frontend applications hosted on approved domains while preventing unauthorized cross-origin access.
