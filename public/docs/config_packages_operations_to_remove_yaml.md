# operations_to_remove.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\operations_to_remove.yaml`

## Summary
This YAML configuration file disables specific Sylius API operations for both admin and shop contexts by listing them under `operations_to_remove`. The file removes various CRUD operations related to customers, orders, products, promotions, payments, and shipping methods, effectively restricting or customizing the available API endpoints in the Sylius e-commerce platform. This is likely used to either secure the API by preventing certain operations or to enforce custom business logic through alternative implementations.
