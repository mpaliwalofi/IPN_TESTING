# parameters.yml

**Path**: `config\packages\parameters.yml`

## Summary
This Symfony configuration file defines application parameters and their default fallback values for various third-party service integrations. It centralizes API credentials and configuration settings for payment providers (Checkout.com, PayPal), shipping services (Mondial Relay, Shipup), email services (Sendinblue), and other features like Google Maps, allowing the application to run cache warming operations even when environment variables are not yet available.
