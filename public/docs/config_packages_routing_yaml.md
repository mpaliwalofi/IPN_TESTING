# routing.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\routing.yaml`

## Summary
This Symfony framework configuration file sets up basic routing behavior for the application. It configures the router component with `strict_requirements` set to null/default, which controls how strictly the router validates route parameter requirements (when null, it throws exceptions in dev mode but not in production). This file exists to establish the fundamental routing rules that govern how HTTP requests are matched to controllers throughout the Symfony application.
