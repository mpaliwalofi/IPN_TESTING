# stof_doctrine_extensions.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\stof_doctrine_extensions.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file enables and configures the Stof Doctrine Extensions bundle for a Symfony application, specifically activating the "sortable" behavior for Doctrine ORM entities. It allows entities to maintain and manage their sort order automatically, with the default locale set from the application's locale parameter. This is commonly used for implementing drag-and-drop ordering or manual position management of database records.
