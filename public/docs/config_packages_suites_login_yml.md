# login.yml

**Path**: `config\packages\suites\login.yml`

## Summary
This is a Behat test suite configuration file that defines the `api_shop_login` test suite for testing the shop's login functionality through the API in a Sylius e-commerce application. It configures various Behat contexts including database hooks, channel/locale/user transformers, setup contexts for customers and users, and API-specific contexts for email verification and customer login operations. The suite runs tests tagged with both `@shop_login` and `@api` to validate shop customer authentication workflows.
