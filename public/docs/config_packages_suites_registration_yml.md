## Summary
This Behat test suite configuration file defines the `api_shop_registration` test suite for testing the shop customer registration functionality through the API. It orchestrates multiple Behat contexts including database hooks, email handling, data transformation, and setup contexts for channels, customers, locales, and security, all focused on validating the registration flow. The suite specifically runs tests tagged with both `@shop_registration` and `@api` to ensure registration endpoints work correctly in the Sylius e-commerce platform.
