**Path**: `config\packages\sylius\core\sylius.yaml`

## Summary
This YAML configuration file serves as the main Sylius e-commerce framework configuration entry point, importing all core bundle configurations for the application. It aggregates 18 separate configuration files that define settings for essential e-commerce domains including addressing, channels, inventory, orders, payments, products, promotions, shipping, taxation, users, and customers. This centralized import structure allows the Sylius platform to modularize its e-commerce functionality while providing a single configuration point for the core bundle.
