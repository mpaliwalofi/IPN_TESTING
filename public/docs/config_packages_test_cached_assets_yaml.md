# assets.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\test_cached\assets.yaml`

## Summary
This is a Symfony test environment configuration file that configures the framework for cached testing scenarios. It enables test mode, sets up mock file-based session storage for isolation, and disables JSON manifest path for assets (likely to avoid dependency on compiled asset manifests during tests). The configuration ensures tests run with predictable, cached asset handling without requiring real asset compilation or external manifest files.
