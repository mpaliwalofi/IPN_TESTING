# framework.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\test_cached\framework.yaml`

## Summary
This is a Symfony framework configuration file specifically for the test environment with caching enabled. It configures the test mode and sets up mock file-based session storage to simulate session handling during automated testing without requiring actual session persistence. This allows tests to run with cached configurations while maintaining isolated, reproducible session state between test runs.
