# sylius_channel.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\test_cached\sylius_channel.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file enables debug mode for the Sylius Channel component specifically in the test environment with caching enabled. It allows for more verbose logging and error reporting when testing channel-related functionality (such as multi-store or multi-locale features) in Sylius e-commerce applications. The debug setting helps developers troubleshoot channel configuration and behavior during cached test execution.
