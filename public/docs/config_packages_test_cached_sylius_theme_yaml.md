# sylius_theme.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\test_cached\sylius_theme.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file enables a test-specific theme source for Sylius, a Symfony-based e-commerce framework. It registers a "test" theme source with no additional configuration options, allowing the application to load and use themes during testing scenarios. This is likely used to verify theme loading, switching, or rendering functionality in the test environment without affecting production theme configurations.
