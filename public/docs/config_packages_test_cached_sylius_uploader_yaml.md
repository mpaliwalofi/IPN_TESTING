# sylius_uploader.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\test_cached\sylius_uploader.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file imports the test environment's Sylius uploader settings for use in a cached test environment. It enables the test_cached environment to reuse the same file upload configurations (likely for product images, avatars, or other media handling) that are defined in the standard test environment, ensuring consistency between test variants while potentially optimizing test execution through caching.
