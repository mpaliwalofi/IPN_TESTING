# webpack_encore.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\test_cached\webpack_encore.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file disables strict mode for Webpack Encore in the test_cached environment. Strict mode relaxation is typically needed to prevent build failures during cached testing scenarios where certain Webpack Encore validations (like missing entry points or configuration checks) might interfere with test execution.
