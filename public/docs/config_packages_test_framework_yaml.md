# framework.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\test\framework.yaml`

## Summary
This Symfony framework configuration file sets up testing-specific settings for the test environment. It enables the test mode and configures the session storage to use a mock file-based factory, which allows for isolated session handling during automated tests without affecting real session data. This configuration ensures tests can run independently with predictable session behavior.
