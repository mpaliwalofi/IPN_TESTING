# web_profiler.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\test\web_profiler.yaml`

## Summary
This Symfony configuration file disables the Web Profiler debugging tool in the test environment. It turns off the debug toolbar, redirect interception, and data collection to improve test performance and prevent profiler overhead from interfering with automated tests. This ensures tests run faster and more cleanly without the debugging instrumentation needed during development.
