# twig.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\twig.yaml`

## Summary
This Symfony configuration file configures the Twig templating engine with template paths, debug settings, and exposes global variables for Mondial Relay shipping service credentials and Google Maps API integration. It enables these third-party service configurations to be accessible throughout all Twig templates in the application, while also setting up default service container behaviors for dependency injection.
