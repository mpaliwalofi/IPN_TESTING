# uid.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\uid.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file sets up Symfony's UID component to use version 7 UUIDs as the default format for generating unique identifiers throughout the application. UUID version 7 is a time-ordered UUID format that combines timestamp-based ordering with random data, providing both uniqueness and natural chronological sorting capabilities. This configuration ensures consistent UUID generation behavior across the application's services that require unique identifiers.
