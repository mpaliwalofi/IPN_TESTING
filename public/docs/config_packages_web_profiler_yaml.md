# web_profiler.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\web_profiler.yaml`

## Summary
This Symfony configuration file configures the web profiler toolbar behavior for different environments (dev and test). In the development environment, it enables the debugging toolbar and profiler for all requests, while in the test environment it disables both the toolbar display and data collection to avoid performance overhead during automated testing.
