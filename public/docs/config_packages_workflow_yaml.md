# workflow.yaml

**Path**: `config\packages\workflow.yaml`

## Summary
This Symfony framework configuration file sets up the Workflow component but leaves it disabled (null value). It serves as a placeholder configuration that would need to be populated with actual workflow definitions to enable state machine or workflow functionality for business processes in the application.
