## Summary
This configuration file sets up two Strapi plugins for managing product catalog data: "pixie" for action endpoints and "import-akeneo" for importing product information from Akeneo PIM (Product Information Management) system. The import-akeneo plugin is extensively configured with credentials and settings for multiple integrations including Akeneo API, ImageKit for media handling, Google authentication, and optional Sylius e-commerce platform synchronization, enabling a complete product data import and sync workflow with configurable feature flags for availability checks, logging, and pricing updates.
