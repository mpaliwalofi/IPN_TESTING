# api_platform.yaml

**Path**: `config\routes\api_platform.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file sets up the routing for API Platform in a Symfony application. It defines that all API Platform routes should be prefixed with `/api` and automatically discovers API resources using the `api_platform` type. This serves as the entry point for exposing RESTful API endpoints for entities decorated with API Platform annotations/attributes.
