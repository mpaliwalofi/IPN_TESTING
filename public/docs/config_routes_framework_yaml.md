# framework.yaml

**Path**: `config\routes\framework.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file defines routing rules for Symfony's development environment error handling. It imports the FrameworkBundle's error controller routes and makes them accessible under the `/_error` URL prefix, allowing developers to preview and test error pages (like 404, 500, etc.) during development without triggering actual errors.
