# ux_autocomplete.yaml

**Path**: `config\routes\ux_autocomplete.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file defines routing for the UX Autocomplete bundle by importing routes from the AutocompleteBundle package and mounting them under the `/autocomplete` URL prefix. It enables autocomplete functionality endpoints to be accessed at URLs beginning with `/autocomplete`, allowing the application to provide type-ahead search suggestions and autocompletion features through a centralized routing structure.
