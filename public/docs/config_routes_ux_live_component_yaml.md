**Path**: `config\routes\ux_live_component.yaml`

## Summary
This is a Symfony routing configuration file that imports and mounts all routes from the LiveComponentBundle under the `/_components` URL prefix. It enables Symfony UX Live Components functionality by defining where component-related HTTP endpoints (for AJAX updates and interactions) will be accessible, with an optional commented configuration for adding locale-based prefixing to support internationalization.
