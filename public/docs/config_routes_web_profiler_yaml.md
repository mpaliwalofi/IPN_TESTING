**Path**: `config\routes\web_profiler.yaml`

## Summary
This Symfony routing configuration file enables the Web Profiler toolbar and profiler interface in the development environment. It mounts two route collections: the web debug toolbar (WDT) accessible at `/_wdt` and the full profiler interface at `/_profiler`, both used for debugging and performance analysis during development.
