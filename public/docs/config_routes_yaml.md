# routes.yaml

**Path**: `config\routes.yaml`

## Summary
This Symfony routing configuration file defines the application's URL routing structure, including redirects for root and admin paths to environment-specific URLs, payment gateway integrations (PayPal, Payzen, Checkout.com), and infrastructure endpoints. It establishes webhooks for payment processing, a health check endpoint for monitoring, a JWKS endpoint for authentication, and auto-discovers TalonOne promotion engine controllers via attribute routing.
