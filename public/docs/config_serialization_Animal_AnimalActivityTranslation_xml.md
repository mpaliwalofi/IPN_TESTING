# AnimalActivityTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Animal\AnimalActivityTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization groups for the `AnimalActivityTranslation` entity, which handles translations of animal activity names across different locales. It specifies which attributes (`id`, `name`, `locale`) should be included when reading, creating, or updating animal activity translations through the admin interface, enabling proper data exposure control for multilingual animal activity management.
