# AnimalCondition.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Animal\AnimalCondition.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization groups for the `AnimalCondition` entity, controlling which attributes are exposed in different contexts (admin, shop, webmethod). It specifies visibility permissions for entity properties like id, name, code, priority, and icon across various API operations (read, create, update) for different user roles and application areas. The configuration enables fine-grained control over data serialization when the AnimalCondition entity is returned through API endpoints or web services.
