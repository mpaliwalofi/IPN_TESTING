# AnimalFeatureTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Animal\AnimalFeatureTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization groups for the `AnimalFeatureTranslation` entity, which handles translations of animal feature names across different locales. It specifies which attributes (`id`, `name`, `locale`) are exposed during read, create, and update operations in the admin panel, enabling controlled API responses and data access for managing multilingual animal feature content.
