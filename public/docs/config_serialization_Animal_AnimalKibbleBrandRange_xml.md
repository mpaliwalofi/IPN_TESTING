# AnimalKibbleBrandRange.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Animal\AnimalKibbleBrandRange.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization groups for the `AnimalKibbleBrandRange` entity, which represents product ranges or categories for animal kibble (pet food) brands. It controls which attributes (id, name, code, timestamps, and related brands) are exposed in different API contexts, with separate groups for shop/customer-facing endpoints, admin operations (read/create/update), and webmethod integrations.
