## Summary
This is a Symfony serializer configuration file that defines serialization groups for the `AnimalTypeTranslation` entity, which handles translations of animal type names across different locales. It specifies which attributes (`id`, `name`, `locale`) are exposed during admin operations (read, create, update) for managing multilingual animal type data in the application.
