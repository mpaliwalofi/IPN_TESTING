**Path**: `config\serialization\Channel\ChannelPricing.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines serialization groups for the `ChannelPricing` model in a Sylius e-commerce application. It specifies which attributes (id, channelCode, price, originalPrice, minimumPrice) should be included when serializing ChannelPricing objects for different contexts, such as admin subscription reads, order displays, and product variant management operations. The configuration controls data visibility and access across various API endpoints and admin interface operations related to channel-specific pricing.
