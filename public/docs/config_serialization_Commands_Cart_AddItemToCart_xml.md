# AddItemToCart.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Commands\Cart\AddItemToCart.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization mappings for the `AddItemToCart` command, which handles adding product items to a shopping cart. It specifies five attributes (productVariantIri, quantity, subscriptionInterval, upsell, and sourceItemList) that can be serialized/deserialized for both shop-facing and admin-facing cart operations, enabling API communication for cart management functionality in an e-commerce system.
