# ChoosePaymentMethod.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Commands\Checkout\ChoosePaymentMethod.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines serialization groups for the `ChoosePaymentMethod` command in a checkout flow. It specifies which attributes (payment method, order token, payment ID, Google Click ID, session tracking data, user agent, and consent storage settings) should be serialized for both shop-facing and admin-facing payment method selection operations, enabling proper API data transformation during the checkout process.
