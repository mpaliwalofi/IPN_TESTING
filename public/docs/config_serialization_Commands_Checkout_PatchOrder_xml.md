**Path**: `config\serialization\Commands\Checkout\PatchOrder.xml`

## Summary
This XML file defines serialization configuration for the `PatchOrder` command in a checkout/cart context. It specifies which attributes (tracking and analytics-related fields like gclid, gSessionId, customerUserAgent, and Google consent storage flags) should be included when serializing the command for the `shop:cart:patch` serialization group, likely used for updating order information with marketing and analytics data during the checkout process.
