# UpdateShippingSubscriptionOrder.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Commands\SubscriptionOrder\UpdateShippingSubscriptionOrder.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization groups for the `UpdateShippingSubscriptionOrder` command, which handles updates to shipping-related information for subscription orders. It specifies that five attributes (billing address, shipping address, shipping method, pickup point, and a flag for address matching) can be serialized/deserialized in both admin and shop contexts when updating subscription shipping details.
