# UpdateShippingSubscription.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Commands\Subscription\UpdateShippingSubscription.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization rules for the `UpdateShippingSubscription` command class, which handles updating shipping-related information for subscription orders. It specifies that six attributes (billing address, shipping address, shipping method, pickup point, address matching flag, and order spreading option) should be serialized for both admin and shop contexts when updating subscription shipping details.
