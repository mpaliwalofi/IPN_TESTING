# UpdateShippingDto.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Dto\UpdateShippingDto.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization groups for the `UpdateShippingDto` class, which handles updating shipping information for subscriptions. It exposes six shipping-related attributes (billing address, shipping address, shipping method, pickup point options, and spread settings) for both admin and shop-level operations, controlling which fields are included when serializing/deserializing subscription shipping update requests.
