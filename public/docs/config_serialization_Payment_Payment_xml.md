# Payment.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Payment\Payment.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization groups for the Payment entity in a Sylius e-commerce system. It specifies which Payment attributes (id, method, currencyCode, amount) should be included when serializing payment data for different contexts, such as admin panels, shop interfaces, order displays, and subscription management. The configuration enables fine-grained control over what payment information is exposed to different user roles and API endpoints across the application.
