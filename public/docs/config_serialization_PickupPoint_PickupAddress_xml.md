# PickupAddress.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\PickupPoint\PickupAddress.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization groups for the `PickupAddress` entity, which manages pickup point addresses in an e-commerce system. It specifies which fields (`externalReference` and `pickupPoint`) should be exposed across various contexts including admin panels (subscriptions, orders, addresses), shop frontend (cart, orders, account), and external webmethod integrations. The configuration ensures consistent data visibility and access control for pickup point addresses throughout different parts of the application.
