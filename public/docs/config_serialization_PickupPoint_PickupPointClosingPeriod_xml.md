**Path**: `config\serialization\PickupPoint\PickupPointClosingPeriod.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines serialization rules for the `PickupPointClosingPeriod` entity in a Symfony application. It specifies which attributes (`id` and `startDate`) should be included when serializing pickup point closing period data across various serialization contexts (groups) for both admin and shop interfaces, including order management, subscription handling, address display, and cart operations. The configuration ensures consistent data exposure for pickup point availability information throughout different parts of the e-commerce platform.
