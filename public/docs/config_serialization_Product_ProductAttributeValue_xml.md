# ProductAttributeValue.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Product\ProductAttributeValue.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization groups for the `ProductAttributeValue` entity in the Sylius e-commerce platform. It specifies which attributes (id, attribute, value, localeCode, name) should be included when serializing product attribute values for different contexts, such as admin product management, shop display, and CRUD operations on product attribute values. The configuration enables controlled data exposure across different API endpoints and user interfaces by organizing attributes into context-specific serialization groups.
