**Path**: `config\serialization\Product\ProductOptionValueTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization groups for the `ProductOptionValueTranslation` model in Sylius e-commerce platform. It specifies which fields (id, value, locale) should be included when serializing product option value translations across different admin contexts such as creating/updating product options, viewing option values, and creating products. The configuration enables controlled exposure of translation data based on the specific admin operation being performed.
