# ProductOptionValue.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Product\ProductOptionValue.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization rules for the `ProductOptionValue` entity in Sylius e-commerce platform. It specifies which attributes (id, value, option, code) should be included when serializing product option values across different contexts, organized into serialization groups for admin and shop views (e.g., product display, variant management, option configuration). The groups control data exposure based on whether the data is being accessed in admin interfaces or customer-facing shop pages.
