# ProductTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Product\ProductTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization groups for the ProductTranslation entity in the Sylius e-commerce platform. It specifies which translatable product attributes (name, slug, description, meta tags, etc.) should be included when serializing product data for different contexts: admin operations (create, show, update) and shop front-end display. The configuration enables controlled exposure of localized product information based on whether the user is in the admin panel or the customer-facing shop.
