# ProductVariantTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Product\ProductVariantTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This is a Symfony serializer configuration file that defines serialization groups for the `ProductVariantTranslation` entity in the Sylius e-commerce framework. It specifies which translation attributes (`id`, `name`, `locale`) should be included when serializing product variant translations across different contexts like shop orders, cart displays, admin product management, and subscription services. The configuration enables controlled exposure of translation data through API endpoints and different application layers by organizing access permissions into contextual groups.
