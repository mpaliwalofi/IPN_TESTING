# ProductVariant.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Product\ProductVariant.xml`

## Summary
This is a Symfony serializer configuration file that defines serialization rules for the ProductVariant entity in a Sylius e-commerce application. It specifies which attributes (id, weight, code) should be included when serializing ProductVariant objects, and organizes them into named groups for different contexts like admin subscriptions, shop product displays, orders, and API endpoints. This allows the application to control which ProductVariant data is exposed in different API responses and administrative/customer-facing views.
