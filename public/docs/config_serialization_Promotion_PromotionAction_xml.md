# PromotionAction.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Promotion\PromotionAction.xml`

## Summary
This XML file configures serialization groups for the `PromotionAction` entity in a Symfony-based e-commerce application (likely Sylius). It defines which attributes (`id`, `type`, `configuration`) should be included when serializing promotion actions for different contexts, such as admin views (show/create/update), webmethod promotion reads, and order reads. This configuration controls API responses and data transformations by specifying what promotion action data is exposed to different parts of the system.
