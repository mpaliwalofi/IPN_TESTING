# PromotionCoupon.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Promotion\PromotionCoupon.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines serialization groups for the `PromotionCoupon` entity in a Sylius e-commerce application. It specifies which attributes (id, createdAt, updatedAt, code, usageLimit, perCustomerUsageLimit) should be included when serializing promotion coupons for different contexts, such as admin panel views (show/create/update operations) and web API methods. The configuration controls data visibility and access across different parts of the application by organizing attributes into logical serialization groups.
