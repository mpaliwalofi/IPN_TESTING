# PromotionTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Promotion\PromotionTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This XML file configures Symfony serializer mappings for the `PromotionTranslation` entity, which handles localized/translated promotion data in a Sylius e-commerce application. It defines which attributes (`id`, `locale`, `label`) should be included when serializing promotion translation objects for different admin operations (index, show, create, update), enabling proper API responses and data transformation based on the context group.
