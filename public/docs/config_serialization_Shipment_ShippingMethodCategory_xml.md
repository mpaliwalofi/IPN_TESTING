# ShippingMethodCategory.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Shipment\ShippingMethodCategory.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization groups for the `ShippingMethodCategory` entity, controlling which attributes (`id` and `name`) are exposed in different API contexts. It manages data visibility across admin and shop interfaces for various shipping-related operations including orders, subscriptions, pickup points, and cart management. The configuration enables fine-grained control over what shipping method category data is serialized for read, create, and update operations across different user roles and application contexts.
