# ShippingMethodTranslation.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Shipment\ShippingMethodTranslation.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines serialization groups for the `ShippingMethodTranslation` entity in a Sylius-based e-commerce application. It specifies which attributes (`id`, `title`, `name`) should be included when serializing shipping method translations across different API contexts, including admin operations (orders, subscriptions, shipping method CRUD), shop operations (cart, checkout, account), and GraphQL queries. The configuration enables fine-grained control over what translation data is exposed in various parts of the application's API endpoints.
