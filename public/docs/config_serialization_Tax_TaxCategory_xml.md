# TaxCategory.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Tax\TaxCategory.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines serialization groups for the `TaxCategory` model in the Sylius e-commerce framework. It specifies which attributes (`id`, `code`, `name`) should be included when serializing tax category data for different contexts, such as admin operations (index, show, create, update) and GraphQL API queries. The configuration ensures proper data exposure control by mapping specific tax category fields to their appropriate usage contexts within the application's API and admin interface.
