# TaxRate.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Tax\TaxRate.xml`

## Summary
This Symfony serializer configuration file defines serialization groups for the `TaxRate` entity in a Sylius e-commerce application. It specifies which attributes (id, code, category, name, amount, includedInPrice, calculator, startDate) should be included when serializing tax rate data for different admin operations (show, create, update). The configuration controls data exposure in API responses or data transfer scenarios for tax rate management in the admin interface.
