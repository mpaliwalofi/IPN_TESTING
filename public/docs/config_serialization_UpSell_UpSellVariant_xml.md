# UpSellVariant.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\UpSell\UpSellVariant.xml`

## Summary
This XML file defines Symfony serialization groups for the `UpSellVariant` entity, which manages time-bounded upsell product variations in an e-commerce system. It configures which entity attributes (id, startDate, endDate) are exposed in different API contexts, such as admin subscription management, shop cart views, and order displays. The serialization groups control data visibility across admin and shop interfaces, ensuring appropriate access levels for upsell variant information in various parts of the application.
