# AdminUserGroup.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\User\AdminUserGroup.xml`

## Summary
This is a Symfony serializer configuration file that defines serialization groups for the `AdminUserGroup` entity. It specifies which attributes (id, name, accessRights, adminUsers) should be included when serializing admin user group data for different API operations like read, create, update, and display contexts. This configuration controls data exposure and access patterns for admin user group management in what appears to be a Sylius-based e-commerce application.
