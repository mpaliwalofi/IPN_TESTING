# Zone.xml

**Path**: `config\serialization\Zone\Zone.xml`

## Summary
This is a Symfony serializer configuration file that defines serialization groups for the `Zone` model in the Sylius e-commerce addressing component. It controls which Zone attributes (id, code, name, type, scope, timestamps, and members) are included when serializing Zone entities for different admin operations (create, show, update), enabling fine-grained control over API responses and data exposure in the admin interface.
