**Path**: `config\server.js`

## Summary
This code configures a Strapi server instance by defining core server settings including host, port, application keys, and feature toggles. It enables cron job functionality by importing and registering scheduled tasks, sets up webhook behavior to exclude populated relations for performance optimization, and uses environment variables for flexible deployment configuration across different environments.
