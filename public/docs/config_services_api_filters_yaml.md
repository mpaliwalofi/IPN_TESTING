# filters.yaml

**Path**: `config\services\api\filters.yaml`

## Summary
This Symfony configuration file defines API Platform filters for querying various business entities in what appears to be a pet food/subscription service. It configures search filters for exact matching on fields like customer, state, and product code, as well as ordering filters for sorting results by fields like createdAt, name, and breed name. These filters enable API consumers to perform targeted queries and sorting on subscriptions, orders, offers, customers, kibble brands, and dog breeds through the API Platform's REST endpoints.
