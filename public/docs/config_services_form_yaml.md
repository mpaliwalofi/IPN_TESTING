## Summary
This Symfony service configuration file defines form types for shipping method gateways and order rules in an e-commerce application. It registers gateway configuration forms for three shipping providers (Mondial Relay, GLS, and Colissimo) with their respective gateway implementations, and sets up an order rule configuration form with validation groups for the Sylius e-commerce framework.
