# registry.yaml

**Path**: `config\services\registry.yaml`

## Summary
This configuration file defines service registries for managing collections of related services in a Sylius-based e-commerce application. It sets up three registries: one for cart validity rule checkers (to validate shopping cart rules), one for form types related to cart validity rules, and one for payment/integration gateways. These registries enable dynamic registration and retrieval of different implementations of cart validation rules and gateway integrations throughout the application.
