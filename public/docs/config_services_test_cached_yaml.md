# services_test_cached.yaml

**Path**: `config\services_test_cached.yaml`

## Summary
This Symfony configuration file imports the base test services configuration (`services_test.yaml`) and is specifically designed for test environments that require caching functionality. It serves as a test environment variant that likely enables or configures cache-related services while inheriting all standard test service definitions, allowing developers to test code behavior with caching mechanisms active.
