## Summary
This Symfony configuration file defines application-wide parameters and environment variable fallbacks for a Sylius-based e-commerce platform that integrates with PrestaShop. It configures essential services including Redis caching, Google Cloud Storage for bill management, ImageKit for image handling, Google Tag Manager analytics, and various system prefixes for orders, customers, subscriptions, and promotions. The file also establishes custom validation groups for customer-related forms and sets up security parameters like the PrestaShop salt for authentication.
