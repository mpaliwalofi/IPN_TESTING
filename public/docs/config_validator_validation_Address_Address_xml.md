# Address.xml

**Path**: `config\validator\validation\Address\Address.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines validation constraints for the `App\Entity\Addressing\Address` entity in a Sylius-based e-commerce application. It specifies validation rules for address properties (customer, alias, company) including length limits, required fields, and regex patterns, organized into different validation groups for various contexts like cart updates, shipping address updates, and admin operations. The file also applies custom constraints for province validation and address removal to ensure data integrity across different address management workflows.
