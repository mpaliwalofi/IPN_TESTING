# ApplyCouponToCart.xml

**Path**: `config\validator\validation\Checkout\ApplyCouponToCart.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines Symfony validation constraints for the `ApplyCouponToCart` command in a Sylius-based e-commerce application. It applies a custom `PromotionCouponEligibility` validator to ensure that coupon codes meet eligibility requirements before being applied to a shopping cart, with validation running in both the "sylius" and "Default" validation groups.
