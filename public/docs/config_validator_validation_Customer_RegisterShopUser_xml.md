# RegisterShopUser.xml

**Path**: `config\validator\validation\Customer\RegisterShopUser.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines validation rules for the `RegisterShopUser` command in a Sylius-based e-commerce application. It specifies constraints for customer registration fields including `firstName` and `lastName`, requiring them to be non-blank, within 1-255 characters, and contain only allowed characters (letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores). The validation rules are grouped under `app_customer` and use custom error messages for form validation feedback during the shop user registration process.
