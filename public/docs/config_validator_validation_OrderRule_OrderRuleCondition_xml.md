# OrderRuleCondition.xml

**Path**: `config\validator\validation\OrderRule\OrderRuleCondition.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines Symfony validation constraints for the `OrderRuleCondition` entity in an e-commerce order management system. It enforces that the `type` property of an order rule condition must not be blank, ensuring that every condition applied to order rules has a specified type when validated within the "sylius" validation group.
