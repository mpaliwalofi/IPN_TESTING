# Order.xml

**Path**: `config\validator\validation\Order\Order.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines Symfony validation constraints for the `Order` entity in an e-commerce application. It specifies two custom validators (`ShippingMethodConsistency` and `BillingAddress`) that are applied to orders within the "sylius" validation group, ensuring that orders have valid shipping methods and billing addresses before processing.
