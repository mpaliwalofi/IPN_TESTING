# RemoveCart.xml

**Path**: `config\validator\validation\Order\RemoveCart.xml`

## Summary
This XML configuration file defines validation constraints for the `RemoveCart` command in a Sylius-based e-commerce application. It applies a custom `RemoveCartEligibility` validator to ensure that cart removal operations meet specific business rules before execution, with validation applied to both the Default and Sylius validation groups.
