# UpdateShipping.xml

**Path**: `config\validator\validation\Shipment\UpdateShipping.xml`

## Summary
This XML file defines Symfony validation constraints for the `UpdateShipping` command class in a Sylius-based e-commerce application. It applies a custom validator (`UpdateShippingPickupPoint`) to ensure that shipping updates properly handle pickup point validation, with the validation constraint scoped to the "sylius" validation group for controlled execution within the Sylius framework's workflow.
