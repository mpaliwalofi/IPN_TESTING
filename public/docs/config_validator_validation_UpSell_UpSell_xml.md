# UpSell.xml

**Path**: `config\validator\validation\UpSell\UpSell.xml`

## Summary
This XML file defines Symfony validation constraints for the `UpSell` entity in an e-commerce upselling system. It applies a custom `UniqueUpSell` validator to ensure that upsell configurations are unique, with validation rules executed within the "sylius" validation group (indicating integration with the Sylius e-commerce framework).
