## Summary
This documentation file defines a taxonomy of dynamic content blocks (components) available for different page types in a B2C/B2B e-commerce platform. It categorizes reusable UI blocks by context (homepage, product pages, cart, account management, etc.), enabling content teams to compose pages dynamically using predefined components like carousels, cross-sells, hero banners, and forms. The structure supports both business-to-consumer (b2c) and business-to-business (b2b) use cases, with specialized blocks for customer journeys including product browsing, checkout, account management, and content marketing.
