# eslint.config.js

**Path**: `eslint.config.js`

## Summary
This is an ESLint configuration file for a Nuxt.js project that sets up linting rules for JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, and Tailwind CSS files. It combines recommended configurations from multiple ESLint plugins (JS, TypeScript, Vue, Tailwind, and Prettier) while customizing specific rules to disable certain Vue and TypeScript warnings (like multi-word component names and explicit-any checks) and to allow short-circuit expressions and ternary operators.
