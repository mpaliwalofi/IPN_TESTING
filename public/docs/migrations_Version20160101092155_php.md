## Summary
This is a Doctrine database migration file for Sylius e-commerce framework that serves as a placeholder migration for regenerating Sylius 1.X migrations into the 2.0 version. The migration intentionally performs no database schema changes (empty `up()` method) and only clears middleware configuration, acting as a reference point or marker in the migration history during the framework's major version upgrade.
