# README.md

**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\README.md`

## Summary
This is a template README file for a Nuxt.js e-commerce module that has not yet been customized from its boilerplate state. The file contains placeholder content with generic "My Module" references and instructions to find-and-replace template values with actual module details. It serves as a starting point for documenting a new Nuxt module, providing standard sections for features, installation instructions, contribution guidelines, and npm badge links that need to be populated with the actual e-commerce module's information.
