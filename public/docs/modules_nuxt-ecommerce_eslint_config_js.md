# eslint.config.js

**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\eslint.config.js`

## Summary
This is an ESLint configuration file for a Nuxt e-commerce module that sets up linting rules for the development environment. It configures Nuxt-specific linting with tooling support for module authors, designates the playground directory as the source, and customizes Vue and TypeScript rules by disabling certain Vue component naming requirements and allowing short-circuit expressions in TypeScript code.
