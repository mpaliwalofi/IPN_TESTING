# app.vue

**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\playground\app.vue`

## Summary
This is the root application component for a Nuxt e-commerce module playground/testing environment. It serves as the main entry point that renders a simple header message and the NuxtPage component, which acts as a router outlet for displaying different pages during module development and testing. The playground allows developers to interactively test and demonstrate the nuxt-ecommerce module's functionality in isolation.
