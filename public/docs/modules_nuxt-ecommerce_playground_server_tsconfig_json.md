# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\playground\server\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for the server-side code in a Nuxt e-commerce playground/development environment. It extends the auto-generated TypeScript configuration from Nuxt's build process, ensuring the server code uses the same type definitions and compiler settings as the main Nuxt application.
