## Summary
This TypeScript type definition file establishes a custom hook system for tracking e-commerce events in a Nuxt application. It defines type-safe interfaces (`TNuxtCustomHooks` and `THookPayload`) that enable registration and execution of tracking event hooks, allowing different parts of the application to listen for and respond to e-commerce tracking events (like purchases, page views, etc.) with optional callbacks and tracker configurations.

## Interfaces

## Type Aliases
