# Breadcrumb.vue

**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\src\runtime\components\Breadcrumb.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders a breadcrumb navigation trail for an e-commerce site, dynamically building breadcrumb items from props that can include a predefined breadcrumb structure and a current page title (either as a string or extracted from a Strapi page object). The component automatically injects structured data (schema.org BreadcrumbList JSON-LD) into the page head for SEO purposes, helping search engines understand the site's hierarchical navigation structure.
