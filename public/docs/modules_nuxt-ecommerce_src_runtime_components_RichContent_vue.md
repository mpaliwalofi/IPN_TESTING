**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\src\runtime\components\RichContent.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders rich text content (markdown) for an e-commerce application by accepting markdown data through props and converting it to HTML using a markdown renderer. The component enforces a specific heading hierarchy (starting at H2 level as defined by STRAPI_HEADING_LEVEL) and displays the rendered content in a styled prose container with responsive margins, likely used for product descriptions, content pages, or other formatted text sections sourced from a Strapi CMS.
