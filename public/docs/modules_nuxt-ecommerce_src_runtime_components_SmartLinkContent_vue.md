**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\src\runtime\components\SmartLinkContent.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component serves as a wrapper for smart links in an e-commerce context, enhancing them with optional icon imagery. It renders a `SmartLink` component with passed-through attributes and slot content, conditionally displaying a `SmartImage` icon (20x20px) aligned to the right if an icon with data is provided in the attributes, commonly used for navigation links or call-to-action buttons that need accompanying visual indicators.
