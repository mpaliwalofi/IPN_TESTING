## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file that defines interactive documentation and visual test cases for the USPGrid Vue component, which displays Unique Selling Points (USPs) in an e-commerce context. It exports four story variants demonstrating different layout configurations: icons and images displayed in both row and column orientations, with configurable responsive behavior for mobile and desktop viewports. The stories use mock data (`uspsIcons` and `uspsRecipe`) to showcase how USPs can be rendered with different visual treatments in the e-commerce module.
