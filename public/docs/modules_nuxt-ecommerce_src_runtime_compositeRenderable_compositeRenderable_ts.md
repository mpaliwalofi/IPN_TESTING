## Summary
This class serves as a mapping between Strapi CMS component types and their corresponding Vue components in a Nuxt e-commerce application. It stores a Strapi API component identifier alongside its Vue component loader, and provides an `is()` method to check if a given Strapi component matches this mapping, enabling dynamic component rendering based on CMS content.
