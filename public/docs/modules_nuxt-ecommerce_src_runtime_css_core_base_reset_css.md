# reset.css

**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\src\runtime\css\core\base\reset.css`

## Summary
This CSS file provides base-level styling resets and normalization for a Nuxt e-commerce application. It enables smooth scrolling, applies anti-aliasing to text for better rendering, removes default browser styling from inputs, and includes a debug utility that visually displays relevancy data attributes (likely for search/product ranking testing). The styles are organized within Tailwind's `@layer base` to ensure proper CSS cascade ordering.
