## Summary
This CSS file provides utility classes for managing scrollbar visibility and scroll behavior in an e-commerce application. It defines a `.no-scrollbar` class that hides scrollbars across all major browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE, Edge) while maintaining scrolling functionality, and a `.prevent-scroll` class that locks the viewport to prevent scrolling entirely. These utilities are typically used for modal overlays, custom-styled scrollable containers, or when implementing custom UI components that require scroll control without visible scrollbars.
