## Summary
This CSS file defines styling for USP (Unique Selling Proposition) components in an e-commerce application, providing flexible layout options for displaying promotional messages or key features with icons and text. It implements responsive layouts with Tailwind utility classes that support both column and row orientations on mobile and desktop viewports, allowing USPs to be displayed horizontally (icon + text side-by-side) or vertically (icon above text) depending on screen size and configuration.
