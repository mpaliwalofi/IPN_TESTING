## Summary
This CSS file defines transition animations for a Nuxt e-commerce application using Tailwind's utility layer. It provides reusable transition classes for layout/page changes (fade in/out), generic fade effects with configurable delays, and specialized notification animations that slide in from bottom on mobile or from right on desktop. These transitions enhance the user experience during navigation and UI state changes in the e-commerce storefront.
