## Summary
This CSS file defines typography configuration for a Nuxt e-commerce module by importing the Poppins font family through @font-face declarations. It includes multiple font weights (300, 400) and styles (normal, italic) in both WOFF and WOFF2 formats for Latin and Latin Extended character sets, with font-display swap optimization for better web performance.
