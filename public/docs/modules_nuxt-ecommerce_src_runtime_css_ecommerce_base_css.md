## Summary
This CSS file defines the base styling and layout rules for a Nuxt e-commerce module using Tailwind CSS utility classes. It establishes the foundational visual design (colors, fonts, spacing) and implements a grid-based page layout system with responsive breakpoints for main content sections. The file also includes conditional visibility rules that show/hide elements based on user authentication state (anonymous, logged-in, or subscriber) for personalized content display in the e-commerce application.
