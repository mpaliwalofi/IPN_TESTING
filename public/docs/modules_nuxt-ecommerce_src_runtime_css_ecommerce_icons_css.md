## Summary
This CSS file serves as a centralized import hub for icon-related font stylesheets in the Nuxt e-commerce module. It aggregates three specialized icon font sets: general UI icons (upd-icons), unique selling proposition (USP) icons, and FAQ-related icons, making them available throughout the e-commerce application. This organization allows for modular management of different icon categories while providing a single entry point for icon styling.
