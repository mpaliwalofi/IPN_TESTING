## Summary
This CSS file serves as a central import hub for shared e-commerce component styles in a Nuxt application. It aggregates common styling configurations for editorial content (edito), tags, and badges by importing their respective stylesheet modules. This organization pattern allows for modular CSS management and reusability of common UI elements across the e-commerce platform.
