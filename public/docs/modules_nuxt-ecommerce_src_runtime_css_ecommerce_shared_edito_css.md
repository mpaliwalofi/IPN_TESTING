## Summary
This CSS file defines styling for editorial content checkmark lists in an e-commerce application. It creates custom-styled unordered lists where default list markers are removed and replaced with icon-based checkmarks positioned absolutely to the left of each list item. The styles use Tailwind CSS utility classes to implement a visually enhanced checklist pattern commonly used in product features, benefits lists, or editorial content sections.
