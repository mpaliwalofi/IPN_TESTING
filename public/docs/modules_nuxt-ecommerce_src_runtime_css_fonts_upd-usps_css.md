## Summary
This CSS file defines a custom icon font named "upd-usps" for an e-commerce module, providing cross-browser compatible font-face declarations with multiple format fallbacks (EOT, WOFF2, WOFF, TTF, SVG). The file maps CSS classes to Unicode characters for various e-commerce and pet-related icons including payment methods (Bancontact), discounts, pet categories (dogs, cats, chickens by size), and UI elements (call center, desktop shop, social media). This icon font system allows the e-commerce application to display consistent vector icons across different browsers and devices using simple CSS classes.
