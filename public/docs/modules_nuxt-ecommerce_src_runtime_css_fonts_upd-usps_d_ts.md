## Summary
This TypeScript declaration file defines an enumeration of icon identifiers for an e-commerce platform's design system, specifically for USP (Unique Selling Points) related icons. The enum maps human-readable icon names to their corresponding CSS class strings (prefixed with "upd-usps-"), covering various categories including payment methods (Mastercard, Paypal, Bancontact), social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram, TikTok), pet-related icons (dog/cat variants, kibbles), and e-commerce features (shipping, discounts, shopping). This provides type-safe access to icon class names throughout the Nuxt e-commerce application.
