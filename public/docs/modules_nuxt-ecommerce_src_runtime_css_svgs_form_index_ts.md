## Summary
This file serves as a centralized export module for SVG icons used in pet food-related forms within an e-commerce application. It imports and re-exports 23 SVG assets representing different pet conditions (cats and dogs with various activity levels, body conditions like overweight/underweight/perfect) and food types (kibbles, homemade, toppers, etc.), making them easily accessible as a single collection for use in product recommendation or pet assessment forms.
