## Summary
This file configures Tailwind CSS for the Nuxt e-commerce module by importing Tailwind's three core style layers: base styles (browser resets and defaults), component classes, and utility classes. It serves as the entry point for enabling Tailwind CSS styling throughout the e-commerce application, allowing developers to use Tailwind's utility-first CSS framework for building the storefront UI.
