## Summary
This CSS file serves as the main stylesheet entry point for a Nuxt-based e-commerce application's front-end core styling. It orchestrates the import order of various stylesheets, starting with Tailwind CSS as the foundation, followed by core UI elements (base styles, transitions, typography, components), and then e-commerce-specific styles (base, footer, icons, shared components). The file also includes a specific z-index override for the Booxi iframe integration, ensuring proper layering of the booking widget.
