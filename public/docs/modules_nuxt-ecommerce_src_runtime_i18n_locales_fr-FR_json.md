## Summary
This is an empty French (France) locale configuration file for internationalization (i18n) in a Nuxt e-commerce module. It serves as a placeholder for French translations of UI strings, labels, and messages that would be used throughout the e-commerce application. When populated, it would contain key-value pairs mapping translation keys to their French language equivalents for the fr-FR locale.
