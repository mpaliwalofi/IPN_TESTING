## Summary
This is an empty JSON locale file for Dutch (Belgium) translations in a Nuxt e-commerce module's internationalization (i18n) system. It serves as a placeholder or initialization point for Dutch-Belgian language translations that would be used to localize the e-commerce application's user interface and content for Belgian Dutch-speaking users.
