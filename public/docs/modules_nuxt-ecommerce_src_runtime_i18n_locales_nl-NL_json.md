## Summary
# Summary

This is an empty JSON locale file for Dutch (Netherlands) language translations in a Nuxt e-commerce module's internationalization (i18n) system. It serves as a placeholder or starting point for defining Dutch language strings and labels that would be used throughout the e-commerce application's user interface. When populated, it would contain key-value pairs mapping translation keys to their Dutch text equivalents for product pages, checkout flows, and other e-commerce features.
