## Summary
This Nuxt plugin registers and configures multiple UltraPremiumDirect design system components (accordion, carousel, counter, heading, forms, images, etc.) for use throughout the e-commerce application. It initializes these Vue components as global plugins, with special configuration for the SmartImage component that integrates with ImageKit for image optimization and the SmartLink component that uses Nuxt's routing system. The plugin serves as a central registration point to make the company's design system components available across the entire Nuxt application.
