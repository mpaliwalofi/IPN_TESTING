# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\src\runtime\server\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This TypeScript configuration file extends the base server-side TypeScript settings from the parent Nuxt build directory. It serves as the TypeScript compiler configuration specifically for the server-side runtime code of the nuxt-ecommerce module, ensuring proper type checking and compilation settings are inherited for server-only code execution.
