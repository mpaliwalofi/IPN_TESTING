## Summary
This Tailwind CSS configuration file sets up styling for a Nuxt-based e-commerce application by importing multiple custom UI component plugins (accordion, carousel, form, image, etc.) and the Typography plugin. It defines a safelist of CSS classes that should never be purged during production builds, including animation transitions (page/layout/fade effects), typography sizes, and font families to ensure dynamic styling remains functional.
