## Summary
This Tailwind CSS plugin defines two utility classes for e-commerce layout standardization: `.grid-default` creates a 12-column grid layout with base gap spacing, and `.responsive-containered` applies responsive horizontal padding that converts to a container on medium+ screens. It exists to provide consistent, reusable layout patterns across the Nuxt e-commerce application without repeatedly writing the same grid and container styles.
