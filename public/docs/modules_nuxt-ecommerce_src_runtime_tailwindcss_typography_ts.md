## Summary
This Tailwind CSS plugin defines custom typography utility classes for an e-commerce Nuxt module. It creates responsive heading styles (`.base-h1` through `.base-h6`) with predefined font sizes and weights that scale up on larger screens, plus a `.size-of-bold` utility that pre-calculates layout space for bold text to prevent layout shifts during font-weight changes.
