## Summary
This class implements a tracking event specifically for menu navigation interactions in an e-commerce application. It extends a base `TrackingEvent` class to capture and format data about user clicks on menu items, including the location within the menu, a descriptive label, and optional custom event names and actions, which are then serialized for Google Tag Manager (GTM) analytics tracking.
