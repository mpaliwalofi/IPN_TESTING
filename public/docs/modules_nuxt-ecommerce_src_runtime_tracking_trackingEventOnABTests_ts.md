**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\src\runtime\tracking\trackingEventOnABTests.ts`

## Summary
This class implements A/B test tracking for e-commerce analytics by extending the base `TrackingEvent` class. It captures and formats A/B test variant information (stored as key-value pairs) into a GTM (Google Tag Manager) custom event with the event name 'abtests'. The primary purpose is to enable tracking of which A/B test variants users are exposed to during their e-commerce session for analytics and optimization purposes.
