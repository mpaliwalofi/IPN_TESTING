**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\src\runtime\tracking\trackingEventSearch.ts`

## Summary
This class represents a search tracking event for e-commerce analytics, extending the base `TrackingEvent` class to capture user search behavior. It stores the search term entered by users and formats it into a standardized data structure (converting camelCase `searchTerm` to snake_case `search_term`) for tracking/analytics systems. This enables e-commerce platforms to monitor what products or content users are searching for, which is crucial for understanding user intent and improving search functionality.
