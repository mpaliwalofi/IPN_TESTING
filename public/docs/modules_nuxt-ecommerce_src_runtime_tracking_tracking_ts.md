## Summary
This file serves as a centralized export module for e-commerce tracking functionality in a Nuxt application. It aggregates and re-exports various tracking-related modules including Google Tag Manager (GTM) events, Pixie analytics events, and standardized tracking events for common e-commerce actions like page views, searches, newsletter subscriptions, form errors, and menu navigation. This barrel export pattern simplifies imports for consumers by providing a single entry point to access all tracking utilities.
