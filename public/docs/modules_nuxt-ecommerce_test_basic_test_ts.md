## Summary
This is an end-to-end test file for the nuxt-ecommerce module that verifies server-side rendering (SSR) functionality. It sets up a test environment using Nuxt's testing utilities with a basic fixture, then validates that the index page renders correctly by checking for expected HTML content in the server response.
