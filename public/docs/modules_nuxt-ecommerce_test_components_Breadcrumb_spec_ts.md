**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\test\components\Breadcrumb.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a unit test file for a Breadcrumb component in a Nuxt e-commerce module. It verifies the component's ability to render breadcrumb navigation items correctly, including testing scenarios with no items, items from mock data, and dynamically added "current" items from various input formats (string, object, or opengraph metadata). The tests ensure proper mounting, correct list item counts, and accurate text rendering based on different prop configurations.
