# Debug.spec.ts

**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\test\components\Debug.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a unit test file for a Debug Vue component in a Nuxt e-commerce module. It verifies the component mounts correctly and tests its snapshot rendering behavior, specifically checking that it displays an empty pre-formatted block by default and correctly renders JSON-stringified parameters when props are passed to it. The Debug component appears to be a developer utility for displaying debugging information in a formatted pre tag during development.
