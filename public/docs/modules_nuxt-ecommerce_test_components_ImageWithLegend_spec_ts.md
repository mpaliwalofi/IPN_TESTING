# ImageWithLegend.spec.ts

**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\test\components\ImageWithLegend.spec.ts`

## Summary
This test file validates the `ImageWithLegend` Vue component, which displays an image with an optional caption/legend that can be clickable or non-clickable. The tests verify the component's rendering behavior under various conditions: mounting with/without parameters, handling missing images, and correctly rendering as either a clickable link (with configurable target="_blank" or target="_self") or a non-clickable span element based on the presence of a URL. This is part of a Nuxt e-commerce module's component testing suite ensuring proper image presentation functionality.
