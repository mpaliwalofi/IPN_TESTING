## Summary
This file contains unit tests for the `RichContent.vue` component, which is part of a Nuxt e-commerce module that renders rich text content (likely product descriptions or informational content about dog food, based on the French text in the snapshot). The tests verify that the component mounts correctly with mock parameters and that it renders HTML content within a styled prose container, using snapshot testing to ensure consistent rendering of the formatted text output.
