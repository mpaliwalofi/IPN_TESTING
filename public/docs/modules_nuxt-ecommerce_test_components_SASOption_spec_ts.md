## Summary
This is a test suite for the `SASOption` Vue component, which appears to be a self-service account option link/button used in an e-commerce interface (e.g., "Mes commandes" / "My Orders"). The tests verify that the component can be mounted, supports dynamic HTML tag rendering (default link vs button), and maintains consistent UI output through snapshot testing to ensure the component displays correctly with its icon, title, and styling classes.
