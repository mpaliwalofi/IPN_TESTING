**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\test\components\SmartFormChoicesField.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a placeholder test file for the `SmartFormChoicesField` component in a Nuxt e-commerce module. The test suite is currently skipped (contains no actual tests), indicating that testing for this component handling form choice fields (likely dropdowns, radio buttons, or checkboxes for product options) has not yet been implemented. This file serves as a stub to mark where tests should eventually be written for validating the choices field functionality in smart forms.
