# SmartFormPhoneField.spec.ts

**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\test\components\SmartFormPhoneField.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a skipped test file for the SmartFormPhoneField component in a Nuxt e-commerce module. The test suite has been intentionally disabled (using `describe.skip`), indicating that phone field validation or functionality tests are either incomplete, temporarily disabled, or awaiting implementation. This placeholder ensures the test file structure exists for future phone number input field testing in the e-commerce form system.
