**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\test\components\SmartForm.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a test file for the SmartForm Vue component in a Nuxt e-commerce module. It verifies the component's ability to mount correctly, handle different field types (checkboxes, inputs), manage form state, and process form submissions with various success and error scenarios including validation errors and network failures. The tests use a FakeForm class to simulate form behavior and stub out individual field components for isolated testing.

## Classes
- `FakeForm`
