**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\test\components\TextSEO.spec.ts`

## Summary
This test file validates the `TextSEO` Vue component, which renders SEO-optimized text content with responsive markdown support for e-commerce pages. The tests verify that the component correctly handles different combinations of desktop and mobile markdown content (rendering 1 or 2 `.prose` elements accordingly), properly renders links from props, and maintains consistent snapshot output. The component appears designed to display promotional or informational text blocks that can be tailored separately for mobile and desktop viewports while maintaining SEO benefits.
