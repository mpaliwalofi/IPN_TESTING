## Summary
This file contains unit tests for a TimeLine Vue component in an e-commerce module. The tests verify that the component mounts correctly and renders the expected number of timeline article elements based on mock data, with an additional snapshot test to ensure the component's HTML output structure (displaying product launch milestones with dates, titles, and descriptions) remains consistent across changes.
