## Summary
This is a unit test file for the `USPCard` Vue component, which appears to be a reusable card component for displaying Unique Selling Points (USPs) in an e-commerce application. The tests verify the component's default prop values (like layout options, text styling, and size variants), rendering behavior with different HTML tags (div/span), and its ability to display either icons or images based on the provided props.
