## Summary
This is a test file for the USPGrid Vue component, which displays a grid of Unique Selling Points (USPs) for an e-commerce application. The tests verify default prop values (styling classes, layout flags), ensure the component correctly renders the number of USPCard child components based on the provided `usps` data array, and validate behavior with both empty and populated USP lists containing attributes like icons and promotional text (e.g., "Prix direct usine", "shipping express").
