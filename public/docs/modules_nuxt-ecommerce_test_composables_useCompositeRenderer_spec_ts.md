## Summary
This is a placeholder test file for the `useCompositeRenderer` composable in a Nuxt e-commerce module. The test suite is currently skipped (not executed), indicating that either the tests haven't been implemented yet or the functionality is temporarily disabled from testing, likely awaiting proper test coverage for composite rendering functionality in the e-commerce context.
