# useTracking.spec.ts

**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\test\composables\useTracking.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a placeholder test file for the `useTracking` composable in a Nuxt e-commerce module. The file exists to maintain test file structure but currently contains only a skipped test suite, indicating that tracking functionality tests (likely for analytics or user behavior monitoring in the e-commerce context) have been deferred or are pending implementation.
