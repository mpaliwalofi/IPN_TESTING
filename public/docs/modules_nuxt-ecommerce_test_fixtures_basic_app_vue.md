## Summary
This is a minimal test fixture for the Nuxt e-commerce module that serves as a basic application entry point for testing purposes. It renders a simple "basic" text placeholder without any actual functionality, providing the bare minimum structure needed to verify that the Nuxt application can mount and render. This fixture is used in the module's test suite to validate basic setup and configuration scenarios.
