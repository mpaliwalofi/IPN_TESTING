## Summary
This is a package configuration file for a basic test fixture used in the nuxt-ecommerce module's test suite. It defines a private, non-publishable npm package named "basic" configured as an ES module, which serves as a minimal test environment to verify the nuxt-ecommerce module's functionality in isolation.
