## Summary
This file exports a mock data object representing an embedded YouTube video component for testing purposes in a Nuxt e-commerce application. The mock contains oEmbed metadata (including video URL, title, thumbnail, and iframe embed code) for a French news segment about "Ultra Premium Direct," which can be used to test the rendering and functionality of embedded content components without making actual API calls during testing.
