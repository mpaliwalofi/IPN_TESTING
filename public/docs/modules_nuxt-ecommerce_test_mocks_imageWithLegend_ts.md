# imageWithLegend.ts

**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\test\mocks\imageWithLegend.ts`

## Summary
This file exports a mock data object representing an image-with-legend component for an e-commerce CMS, likely used for testing purposes. The mock includes a clickable image with multiple responsive format sizes (small, medium, large) hosted on ImageKit CDN, associated metadata (dimensions, file sizes, URLs), and a YouTube video link that opens in a new tab. This mock data structure appears to simulate content returned from a headless CMS (possibly Strapi based on the structure) for testing image display and linking functionality in the Nuxt e-commerce module.
