## Summary
This file provides mock image data for testing e-commerce product displays, specifically for a grain-free cat food product for sterilized/indoor adult cats. It exports a default product image and a hover state image, each containing standard image metadata (ID, URL, alt text, and file hash) used to test product listing functionality in the Nuxt e-commerce module.
