## Summary
This file exports a mock object representing rich content data for an e-commerce product page, specifically containing French-language markdown content about dog food health information. It simulates a CMS component structure (likely from Strapi or similar headless CMS) used for testing purposes in a Nuxt e-commerce module, where the rich content would typically be rendered as formatted text on product or informational pages.
