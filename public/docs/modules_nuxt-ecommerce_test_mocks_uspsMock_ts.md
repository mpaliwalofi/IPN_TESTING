## Summary
This file contains a mock data object (`uspsStrapi`) that simulates the structure of a USP (Unique Selling Proposition) component returned from a Strapi CMS API for an e-commerce site (Ultra Premium Direct, a pet food company). The mock represents a promotional section with a title, button, multiple USP items with icons and text (highlighting product quality features like "high-quality ingredients"), and footer text with a pricing claim, used for testing components that consume this CMS data structure.
