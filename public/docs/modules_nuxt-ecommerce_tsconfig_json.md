# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `modules\nuxt-ecommerce\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for a Nuxt e-commerce module that extends the base Nuxt TypeScript settings and establishes project references to shared UI component packages (accordion, carousel, counter, etc.) and utilities. It configures the TypeScript compiler to support JSON module imports and includes type definitions for Nuxt, i18n internationalization, and testing libraries (Vitest and Testing Library), while excluding build artifacts and dependencies from compilation.
