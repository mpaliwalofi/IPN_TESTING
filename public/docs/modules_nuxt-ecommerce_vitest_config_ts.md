## Summary
This is a Vitest configuration file for testing a Nuxt e-commerce module. It sets up the testing environment with Vue support, auto-imports for composables and components, SVG loading capabilities, and configures path aliases to match the Nuxt application structure. The configuration enables test coverage reporting specifically for components and composables directories, using jsdom as the test environment to simulate browser behavior.
