# .eslintrc.config.js

**Path**: `packages\accordionFold\.eslintrc.config.js`

## Summary
This is an ESLint configuration file for the accordionFold package that establishes code quality and linting rules for a Vue 3 project with TypeScript support within an Nx monorepo. It configures Vue 3, TypeScript, and Prettier integration while enforcing Nx module boundaries to ensure proper architectural dependencies between packages. The configuration applies different rule sets based on file types (TypeScript, JavaScript, and Vue files) to maintain consistent code standards across the project.
