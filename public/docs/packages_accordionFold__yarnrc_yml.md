# .yarnrc.yml

**Path**: `packages\accordionFold\.yarnrc.yml`

## Summary
This Yarn configuration file specifies that the package manager should use the traditional `node-modules` linker strategy for dependency installation. It ensures that dependencies for the `accordionFold` package are installed in a classic `node_modules` directory structure rather than using Yarn's newer Plug'n'Play (PnP) system.
