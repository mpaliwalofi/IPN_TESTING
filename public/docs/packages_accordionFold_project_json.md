# project.json

**Path**: `packages\accordionFold\project.json`

## Summary
This is an Nx workspace configuration file for the "accordionFold" library package, which appears to be part of a design system (indicated by the "upd:ds" tag). The configuration defines the project structure, source root location, and includes a linting target for code quality enforcement using ESLint with auto-fix enabled.
