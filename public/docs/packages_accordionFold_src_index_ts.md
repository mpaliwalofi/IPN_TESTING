## Summary
This file serves as the main entry point for an AccordionFold Vue component plugin. It exports the AccordionFold component and provides a Vue plugin installer that registers the component globally and optionally injects configuration options into the Vue app's dependency injection system. The module enables both direct component imports and global plugin-based registration for use across a Vue application.
