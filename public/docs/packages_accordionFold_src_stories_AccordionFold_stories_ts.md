## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file for an AccordionFold Vue3 component that defines interactive stories for testing and documentation purposes. It sets up multiple story variants (Default and Reverse) with automated play functions that simulate user interactions like clicking to expand/collapse the accordion and verify the visibility of content. The file includes viewport configurations for responsive testing across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, and validates the accordion's toggle behavior with timing considerations for CSS transitions.
