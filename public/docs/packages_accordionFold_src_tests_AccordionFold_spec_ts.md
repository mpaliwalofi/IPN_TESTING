**Path**: `packages\accordionFold\src\tests\AccordionFold.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a test suite for an AccordionFold Vue component that validates collapsible/expandable UI functionality. The tests verify the component's mounting behavior, open/closed state management through the `combinedOpen` computed property, click-triggered toggle interactions, and event emission when the accordion is expanded or collapsed. It also includes tests for slot-based content rendering (title and content slots) and various configuration props like `stayOpenDesktop` and `noIconDesktop`.
