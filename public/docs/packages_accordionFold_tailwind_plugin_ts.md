## Summary
This file defines a Tailwind CSS plugin that provides utility classes for creating accordion-style fold/collapse UI components. The plugin adds pre-configured component classes that handle accordion styling including borders, button layouts, rotation animations for expand/collapse icons, content visibility transitions, and responsive behavior (with desktop-specific variants that can keep accordions open or hide toggle icons on larger screens).
