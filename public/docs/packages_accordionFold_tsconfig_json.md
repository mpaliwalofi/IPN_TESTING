# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `packages\accordionFold\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for the `accordionFold` package that extends a base configuration and defines compilation settings. It specifies which files to include in the TypeScript compilation process (Vue components, type definitions, and tailwind files) and configures the compiler to support JSON module imports and testing frameworks (Vitest and Testing Library). The configuration enables TypeScript support for a Vue-based accordion fold UI component with testing capabilities.
