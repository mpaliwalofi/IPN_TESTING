# vite.config.ts

**Path**: `packages\accordionFold\vite.config.ts`

## Summary
This Vite configuration file sets up the build process for an "AccordionFold" component library package within the UltraPremiumDirect Design System. It configures the package to be built as an ES module library with a specific entry point and output filename, merging these settings with a base Vite configuration from the monorepo root. The configuration ensures the accordion fold component can be independently built and distributed as part of the design system.
