# .yarnrc.yml

**Path**: `packages\boilerplate\.yarnrc.yml`

## Summary
This is a Yarn package manager configuration file that specifies the node linker strategy for the boilerplate package. It explicitly sets `nodeLinker` to "node-modules" mode, which configures Yarn to use the traditional node_modules directory structure for dependency installation rather than Yarn's newer Plug'n'Play (PnP) approach, likely for compatibility reasons with existing tooling or development workflows.
