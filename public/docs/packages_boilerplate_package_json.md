# package.json

**Path**: `packages\boilerplate\package.json`

## Summary
This is a package.json configuration for a Vue 3-based design system boilerplate package (@ultrapremiumdirect/boilerplate) that provides reusable UI components and a Tailwind CSS plugin. The package is built as an ES module using Vite, includes TypeScript support, internationalization (vue-i18n), and is set up for distribution with both component exports and a custom Tailwind plugin for styling integration. It's designed to be published as a shared library within a monorepo workspace (using Yarn workspaces) to standardize UI components across Ultra Premium Direct applications.
