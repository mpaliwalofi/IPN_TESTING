# Boilerplate.vue

**Path**: `packages\boilerplate\src\components\Boilerplate.vue`

## Summary
This is a minimal Vue.js component that serves as a placeholder or starting template for the boilerplate package. It renders a simple `&lt;span&gt;` element containing the text "boilerplate" with no logic or interactivity. This component exists as a basic scaffolding example that developers can use as a foundation to build more complex components within the boilerplate structure.
