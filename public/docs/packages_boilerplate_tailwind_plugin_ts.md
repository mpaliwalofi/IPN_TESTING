**Path**: `packages\boilerplate\tailwind\plugin.ts`

## Summary
This file defines a minimal Tailwind CSS plugin that serves as a boilerplate/template for adding custom component styles. Currently, it registers an empty components object, indicating it's either a placeholder for future custom components or a starter template that will be populated with reusable UI component classes. The plugin integrates with Tailwind's plugin system to extend the framework's default styling capabilities.
