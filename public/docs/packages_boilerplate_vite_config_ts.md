# vite.config.ts

**Path**: `packages\boilerplate\vite.config.ts`

## Summary
This Vite configuration file sets up the build process for the UltraPremiumDirect Design System Boilerplate package as a library. It merges a base Vite configuration with package-specific settings that define the library entry point, output format (ES modules only), and naming convention for the built artifacts. The configuration enables this boilerplate package to be compiled and distributed as a reusable component library within the larger design system.
