# project.json

**Path**: `packages\carousel\project.json`

## Summary
This is an Nx workspace configuration file for a "carousel" library package. It defines the project structure, marking it as a library type with source code in `packages/carousel/src`, and configures linting as the primary build target with auto-fix enabled. The configuration serves as metadata for the Nx build system to manage the carousel component library within a monorepo architecture.
