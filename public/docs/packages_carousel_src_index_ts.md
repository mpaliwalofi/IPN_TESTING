## Summary
This file serves as the main entry point for a Vue 3 carousel component library, exporting the Carousel component, useCarousel composable, and a Vue plugin for global installation. The plugin allows the carousel to be registered globally across a Vue application with optional configuration through dependency injection, making it available as a reusable UI component for displaying rotating/sliding content.
