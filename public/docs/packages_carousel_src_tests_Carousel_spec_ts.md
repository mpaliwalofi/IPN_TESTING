# Carousel.spec.ts

**Path**: `packages\carousel\src\tests\Carousel.spec.ts`

## Summary
This file contains unit tests for a Vue Carousel component, verifying its core navigation functionality. The tests validate that the carousel correctly renders, updates its current slide index when users click navigation arrows (with proper boundary handling for non-infinite mode), and responds to dot indicator clicks. The test suite ensures the carousel's state management works properly across different configuration options like arrows, dots, infinite scrolling, and slide navigation.
