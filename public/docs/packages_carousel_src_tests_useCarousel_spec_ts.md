**Path**: `packages\carousel\src\tests\useCarousel.spec.ts`

## Summary
This test file validates the `useCarousel` composable, which provides carousel/slider functionality for Vue components. It tests core carousel behaviors including slide navigation (next/prev), index management, infinite looping, and swipe gesture integration through VueUse utilities. The tests ensure proper slide transitions, boundary handling (with and without infinite mode), and automatic playback intervals.
