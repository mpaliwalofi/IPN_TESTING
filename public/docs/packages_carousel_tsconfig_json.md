## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for a carousel UI component package. It extends a base TypeScript configuration and specifies which files should be included in the compilation process, including Vue components, TypeScript source files, Vue type shims, auto-generated type imports, and Tailwind CSS-related files. This configuration ensures proper type checking and compilation for the carousel package within a monorepo structure.
