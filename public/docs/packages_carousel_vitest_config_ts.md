# vitest.config.ts

**Path**: `packages\carousel\vitest.config.ts`

## Summary
This is a Vitest configuration file for the carousel package that extends a base testing configuration. It merges the monorepo's shared base Vitest config without adding any package-specific test configuration overrides. This allows the carousel package to inherit standardized testing settings from the root while maintaining the flexibility to add custom configuration if needed in the future.
