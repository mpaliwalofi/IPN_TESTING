# .eslintrc.config.js

**Path**: `packages\counter\.eslintrc.config.js`

## Summary
This is an ESLint configuration file for a Vue 3 + TypeScript counter package within an Nx monorepo. It establishes linting rules including Vue 3 essentials, TypeScript support, Prettier formatting integration, and Nx module boundary enforcement to ensure proper dependency management between packages. The configuration applies different rule sets based on file types (TypeScript, JavaScript, and Vue files) and enforces buildable library dependencies through Nx's architectural constraints.
