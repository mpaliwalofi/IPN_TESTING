# .yarnrc.yml

**Path**: `packages\counter\.yarnrc.yml`

## Summary
This is a Yarn package manager configuration file that specifies the node module linking strategy for the "counter" package. It configures Yarn to use the traditional "node-modules" linker, which creates a conventional node_modules directory structure rather than alternative linking strategies like Plug'n'Play (PnP). This ensures compatibility with tools and workflows that expect the standard Node.js module resolution approach.
