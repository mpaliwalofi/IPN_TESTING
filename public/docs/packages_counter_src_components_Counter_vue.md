## Summary
This is a Vue 3 counter component that provides increment/decrement functionality with configurable min/max bounds and an optional open/close toggle feature. The component supports two-way data binding through v-model, emits input events when the count changes, and can be disabled or configured to collapse/expand based on whether the count is at its minimum value.
