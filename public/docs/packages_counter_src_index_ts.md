## Summary
This file serves as the main entry point for a Vue 3 plugin that provides a Counter component as part of a design system. It exports both the Counter component for individual use and a plugin installer that automatically registers the component globally and optionally provides configuration options through Vue's dependency injection system. The plugin allows consumers to either use the Counter component directly or install it application-wide with customizable options.
