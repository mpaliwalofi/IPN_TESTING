# StoryCounters.vue

**Path**: `packages\counter\src\stories\StoryCounters.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component serves as a visual documentation/showcase page for the Counter component, demonstrating its various states and configurations. It displays multiple Counter instances with different properties including disabled state, min/max value constraints (4 and 10), preset values (8), and an open/close toggle variant. The file functions as a Storybook-style story to help developers understand and test the different use cases and visual variations of the Counter component.
