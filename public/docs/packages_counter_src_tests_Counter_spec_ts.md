# Counter.spec.ts

**Path**: `packages\counter\src\tests\Counter.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a test suite for a Counter Vue component that verifies its mounting, props validation, and increment/decrement functionality. The tests ensure that the counter respects minimum and maximum boundaries, properly initializes default values (starting at 0), and correctly triggers increment/decrement methods when buttons are clicked. The suite validates that the counter component enforces constraints like preventing decrements below the minimum value and increments above the maximum value.
