## Summary
This file exports a Tailwind CSS plugin that defines styling components for a counter UI element. The plugin provides utility classes for different counter states (open/closed/disabled), button styles, and text formatting, allowing for a rounded, interactive counter component with hover effects and state-based visual transitions. The counter appears designed to toggle between a compact circular button (width 10) and an expanded state (width 21) showing increment/decrement controls.
