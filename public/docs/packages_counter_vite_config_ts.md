# vite.config.ts

**Path**: `packages\counter\vite.config.ts`

## Summary
This is a Vite build configuration file for a counter component package within the UltraPremiumDirect Design System. It configures the package to be built as an ES module library with the entry point at `src/index.ts`, outputting as `upd-ds-counter.es.js`, while inheriting base configuration from a root Vite config. The configuration enables this counter component to be packaged and distributed as a standalone, reusable library module.
