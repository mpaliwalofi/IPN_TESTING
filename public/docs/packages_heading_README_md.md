**Path**: `packages\heading\README.md`

## Summary
This appears to be a placeholder or template README file for a package named "heading". The file currently contains no meaningful content beyond its title, suggesting it's either a work-in-progress package or awaiting proper documentation that would describe the heading component's functionality within a larger UI component library or design system.
