# .eslintrc.config.js

**Path**: `packages\heading\.eslintrc.config.js`

## Summary
This is an ESLint configuration file for a heading component package in an Nx monorepo. It sets up linting rules for Vue 3 with TypeScript, enforces Nx module boundaries to ensure proper dependency management between packages, and applies different rule sets based on file types (TypeScript, JavaScript, and Vue files). The configuration ensures code quality and architectural constraints are maintained across the heading package.
