## Summary
This file defines Storybook stories for a Vue 3 Heading component that renders semantic HTML heading elements (h1-h6). It configures visual testing across multiple viewports (mobile/desktop) using Chromatic and includes interaction tests that verify each heading level renders with the correct HTML tag. The stories integrate with Strapi's heading level types to ensure consistency between the CMS and component implementation.
