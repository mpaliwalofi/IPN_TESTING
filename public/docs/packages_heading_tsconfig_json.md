# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `packages\heading\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for a "heading" package component within a monorepo structure. It extends a base TypeScript configuration and specifies which files should be included in the compilation process, specifically Vue component files and TypeScript files within the package's src directory along with Vue type definitions. This configuration enables proper TypeScript type checking and compilation for a Vue-based heading UI component.
