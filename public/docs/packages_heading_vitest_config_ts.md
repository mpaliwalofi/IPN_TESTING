**Path**: `packages\heading\vitest.config.ts`

## Summary
This is a Vitest configuration file for the `heading` package that extends the base testing configuration from the monorepo root. It merges the shared base Vitest config without adding any package-specific test settings, ensuring consistent testing behavior across the monorepo while allowing for future customization if needed.
