## Summary
This is an ESLint configuration file for a Vue 3 separator component package within an Nx monorepo. It enforces code quality rules including Vue 3 best practices, TypeScript standards, and Nx module boundary constraints to ensure proper dependency management between packages. The configuration applies different linting rules based on file types (TypeScript, JavaScript, and Vue files) while using Prettier for code formatting.
