# .yarnrc.yml

**Path**: `packages\separator\.yarnrc.yml`

## Summary
This is a Yarn 2+ configuration file that specifies the node linker strategy for the `separator` package. It configures Yarn to use the traditional `node-modules` approach for dependency installation rather than Yarn's newer Plug'n'Play (PnP) system, ensuring compatibility with tools that expect a standard `node_modules` folder structure.
