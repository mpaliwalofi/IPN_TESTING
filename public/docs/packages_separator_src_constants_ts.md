## Summary
This file defines a Vue 3 injection key constant used for providing and injecting separator component configuration throughout the component hierarchy. The injection key is typed with `ISeparator` interface and uses Vue's dependency injection system to enable ancestor components to share separator-related data with descendant components without prop drilling. This is a standard pattern in Vue 3 design systems for managing component context and configuration.
