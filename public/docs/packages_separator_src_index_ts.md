## Summary
This file serves as the main entry point for a Vue 3 separator component package within the UltraPremiumDirect design system. It exports both the Separator component directly and as a Vue plugin that registers the component globally and optionally provides configuration options via dependency injection. The plugin architecture allows the separator component to be easily integrated into Vue applications with centralized configuration management.
