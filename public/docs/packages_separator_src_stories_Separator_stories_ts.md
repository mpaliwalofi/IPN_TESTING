## Summary
This is a Storybook configuration file that defines interactive documentation and visual testing stories for a Separator component. It sets up a default story with example content above and below the separator to demonstrate its visual appearance and spacing behavior, and includes automated tests to verify the component renders correctly with appropriate CSS classes (primary color border, full width). The file configures viewport settings for responsive testing across mobile, tablet, and desktop views, with props for customizing the separator's appearance (dashed style, margins).
