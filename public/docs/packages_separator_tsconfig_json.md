# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `packages\separator\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for a "separator" package that extends a base TypeScript configuration. It specifies which files should be included in the TypeScript compilation process, including Vue components, auto-generated import definitions, source files, and tailwind-related files. This configuration enables TypeScript type-checking and compilation for a Vue-based UI separator component within a monorepo structure.
