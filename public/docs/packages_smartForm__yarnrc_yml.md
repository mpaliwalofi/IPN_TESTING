# .yarnrc.yml

**Path**: `packages\smartForm\.yarnrc.yml`

## Summary
This Yarn configuration file specifies that the `node-modules` linker should be used for dependency management in the smartForm package. It ensures that dependencies are installed using the traditional node_modules folder structure rather than alternative strategies like Plug'n'Play (PnP), which is important for compatibility with tools that expect the classic Node.js module resolution.
