# project.json

**Path**: `packages\smartForm\project.json`

## Summary
This is an Nx workspace configuration file for the "smartForm" library package, which appears to be part of a design system (indicated by the "upd:ds" tag). It defines the library's structure, source location, and build targets, specifically configuring ESLint for code linting with automatic fix capabilities.
