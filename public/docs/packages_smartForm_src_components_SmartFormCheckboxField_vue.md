# SmartFormCheckboxField.vue

**Path**: `packages\smartForm\src\components\SmartFormCheckboxField.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders a checkbox form field for a smart form system, handling two-way data binding through a computed proxy model and supporting internationalization. It integrates with Nuxt's markdown-it plugin to render the checkbox label as markdown, falling back to plain text rendering if the markdown renderer is unavailable. The component is designed to work within a larger smart form framework, accepting field definitions and form metadata as props while emitting updates to parent components.
