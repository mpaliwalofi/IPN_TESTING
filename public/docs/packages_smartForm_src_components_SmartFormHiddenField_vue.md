# SmartFormHiddenField.vue

**Path**: `packages\smartForm\src\components\SmartFormHiddenField.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders a hidden form field within a smart form system. It implements two-way data binding through v-model by accepting a `modelValue` prop and emitting `update:modelValue` events via a computed proxy property. The component serves as a wrapper for HTML hidden inputs, allowing form data to be stored and transmitted without being visible to users while maintaining compatibility with the SmartForm framework's field definition structure.
