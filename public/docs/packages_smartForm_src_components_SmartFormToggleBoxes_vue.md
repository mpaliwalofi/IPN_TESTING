# SmartFormToggleBoxes.vue

**Path**: `packages\smartForm\src\components\SmartFormToggleBoxes.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component renders a toggle box (radio button) selection field for a smart form system. It displays a list of choices as styled radio buttons, manages the selected value through v-model, and automatically sets a default value on mount if none is provided. The component is designed to be part of a larger dynamic form builder system where field definitions and choices are provided through props.
