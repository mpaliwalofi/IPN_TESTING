# SmartForm.vue

**Path**: `packages\smartForm\src\components\SmartForm.vue`

## Summary
This Vue component serves as a dynamic form renderer that accepts a `SmartFormDefinition` and generates a complete form with validation error display. It maps form field definitions to their corresponding specialized field components (checkbox, input, phone, file upload, etc.) and handles form submission by calling the form's `handle()` method. The component provides extensibility through slots for custom field rendering and form content insertion before/after fields.
