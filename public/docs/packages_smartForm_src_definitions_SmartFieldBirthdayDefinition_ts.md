## Summary
This class defines a specialized form field for capturing birthday information in a smart form system. It extends the base `SmartFieldDefinition` to handle birthday data that can be stored either as a complete date or as separate month/year components, with the `isSet` getter implementing custom validation logic to determine if birthday data has been properly entered based on which format is being used.
