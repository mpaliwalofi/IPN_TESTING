## Summary
This class defines a configuration for a button-based form field component in a smart form system. It extends `SmartFieldDefinition` to create a specialized field type that renders as `SmartFormButtonsField`, supporting configurable button arrays with options for required validation, disabled state, and multiple selection capability. The class serves as a type-safe definition layer that maps form field properties to the underlying Vue component's parameters.
