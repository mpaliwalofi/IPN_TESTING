## Summary
This class defines the configuration and behavior for a phone number input field within a smart form system. It extends `SmartFieldDefinition` to provide phone-specific functionality, including support for country selection (with a list of country options), field validation requirements, and reactive configuration options like labels, help messages, and disabled states. The class acts as a definition/schema that maps to a `SmartFormPhoneField` Vue component for rendering international phone number inputs with country code selection.
