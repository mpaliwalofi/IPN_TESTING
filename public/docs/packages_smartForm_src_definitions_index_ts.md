## Summary
This is a barrel file (index module) that serves as a central export point for all SmartForm field definition types. It re-exports various field definition modules (birthday, email, phone, checkbox, file uploads, etc.) and the core SmartForm definition, providing a single import location for consumers of the smartForm package to access all available field type definitions used in dynamic form construction.
