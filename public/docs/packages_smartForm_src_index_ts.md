**Path**: `packages\smartForm\src\index.ts`

## Summary
This is the main entry point for a Vue 3 plugin that provides a comprehensive smart form system with various specialized field components (birthday, phone, file upload, toggle, textarea, etc.). The plugin exports all form-related components and provides an installation mechanism that registers them globally in a Vue application while supporting optional configuration through dependency injection. It serves as a design system package for building dynamic, type-safe forms with pre-built field components.
