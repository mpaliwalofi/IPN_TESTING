**Path**: `packages\smartForm\src\tests\SmartFormBirthdayField.spec.ts`

## Summary
This test file validates the **SmartFormBirthdayField** Vue component, which provides a dual-mode birthday input field that can toggle between age-based entry (months/years) and date-based entry. The tests verify component mounting, default display mode (age mode with months/years inputs), and the ability to switch between the two input modes using a toggle switch.
