# SmartFormChoicesField.spec.ts

**Path**: `packages\smartForm\src\tests\SmartFormChoicesField.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a skipped test file for the SmartFormChoicesField component in a smart form package. The test suite has been disabled (using `describe.skip`), indicating either work-in-progress tests or temporarily disabled test cases for a form field that handles choice/selection inputs. The file exists to eventually contain unit tests validating the behavior of choice-based form fields (such as dropdowns, radio buttons, or checkboxes) within the smart form system.
