# SmartFormTitleField.spec.ts

**Path**: `packages\smartForm\src\tests\SmartFormTitleField.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a skipped test file for the SmartFormTitleField component in a smart form package. The file currently contains no actual test implementations, serving as a placeholder that has been intentionally disabled using `describe.skip()`. It exists to maintain the test file structure for future testing of title field functionality within smart forms, but is currently bypassed during test execution.
