# SmartForm.spec.ts

**Path**: `packages\smartForm\src\tests\SmartForm.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a test file for the SmartForm Vue component that validates form mounting, field rendering, and error handling behavior. It includes a `FakeForm` test helper class that extends `SmartFormDefinition` to simulate form configurations with various field types (checkboxes, inputs, etc.) and error conditions. The tests ensure that SmartForm correctly instantiates with proper IDs, renders child field components through stubs, and handles form submission with both success and error scenarios.
