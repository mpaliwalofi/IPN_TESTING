# .eslintrc.config.js

**Path**: `packages\smartImage\.eslintrc.config.js`

## Summary
This is an ESLint configuration file for the `smartImage` package in an Nx monorepo workspace that uses Vue 3 with TypeScript. It enforces code quality standards by configuring linting rules for Vue components, TypeScript, and JavaScript files, while also implementing Nx module boundary enforcement to maintain proper dependency relationships between packages in the monorepo. The configuration extends recommended rulesets from Vue, ESLint, TypeScript, and Prettier while adding specific Nx workspace constraints to prevent improper cross-package dependencies.
