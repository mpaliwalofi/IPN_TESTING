# .yarnrc.yml

**Path**: `packages\smartImage\.yarnrc.yml`

## Summary
This is a Yarn package manager configuration file that specifies the node linker strategy for the `smartImage` package. It sets `nodeLinker` to `node-modules`, which instructs Yarn to use the traditional node_modules folder structure for dependency installation rather than Yarn's newer PnP (Plug'n'Play) mode.
