# package.json

**Path**: `packages\smartImage\package.json`

## Summary
This package.json defines a Vue.js component library called "smartimage" that provides intelligent image handling functionality, likely with responsive image optimization and lazy loading capabilities. The package exports both ES modules and TypeScript types, includes a Tailwind CSS plugin integration, and uses ImageKit JavaScript (visible in devDependencies) for image transformation and delivery. It's built with Vite, uses Vitest for testing, and is part of a larger monorepo workspace for the UltraPremiumDirect design system.
