## Summary
This file defines a Vue injection key constant used for dependency injection of SmartImage component options within the ultrapremiumdirect design system. The injection key enables parent components to provide configuration options that can be consumed by child SmartImage components throughout the component tree, following Vue 3's provide/inject pattern for sharing data across component hierarchies.
