## Summary
This is a Vue 3 plugin that provides an image optimization system using ImageKit CDN for the UltraPremiumDirect platform. It exports a `SmartImage` component and `useImageKit` composable for handling optimized image delivery from specific CDN URLs, with default configuration for French staging environment media assets including animal photos and SVG graphics. The plugin registers the component globally and allows runtime configuration injection for different deployment environments.
