**Path**: `packages\smartImage\src\tests\SmartImage.spec.ts`

## Summary
This is a test file for the SmartImage Vue component that verifies image optimization functionality using ImageKit CDN integration. The tests validate core features including component mounting, lazy/eager loading behavior, and hash-based cache busting using either `fileHash` or `hash` properties from image objects. The component appears to be part of an image delivery system that leverages ImageKit's JavaScript SDK to generate optimized image URLs with versioning parameters.
