# image.ts

**Path**: `packages\smartImage\src\tests\image.ts`

## Summary
This is a test fixture file that exports mock image data objects for testing image-related functionality in the smartImage package. It provides sample product images (a default image and a hover state image) for cat food products, including metadata like URLs, alt text, and file hashes that would typically be used in e-commerce catalog displays.
