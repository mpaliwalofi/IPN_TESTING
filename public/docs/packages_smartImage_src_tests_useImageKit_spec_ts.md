## Summary
This test file validates the `useImageKit` composable, which provides Vue integration for the ImageKit image transformation service. It tests the composable's ability to transform image URLs by applying transformation parameters (width, height, quality) to both internal and external image URLs, ensuring proper handling of empty URLs, standard URLs, and URLs with transformation options.
