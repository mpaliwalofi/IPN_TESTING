# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `packages\smartImage\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for a "smartImage" package that extends a base TypeScript configuration. It specifies which files and directories should be included in the TypeScript compilation process, including Vue components, type definitions, source files, and Tailwind CSS-related files. The configuration enables TypeScript support for a Vue-based image handling component or utility within a monorepo structure.
