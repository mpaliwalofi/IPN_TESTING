# vite.config.ts

**Path**: `packages\smartImage\vite.config.ts`

## Summary
This Vite configuration file builds a JavaScript library module called "smartImage" as part of a design system package for UltraPremiumDirect. It configures the build to output an ES module format with inline CSS injection, merging base Vite settings with library-specific configurations that define the entry point and output file naming convention.
