# vitest.config.ts

**Path**: `packages\smartImage\vitest.config.ts`

## Summary
This configuration file sets up Vitest (a testing framework) for the `smartImage` package by extending a shared base configuration from the monorepo root. It uses Vitest's `mergeConfig` utility to combine the base testing configuration with package-specific settings (currently none), enabling consistent test execution across the monorepo while allowing for future package-specific test customizations.
