# .eslintrc.config.js

**Path**: `packages\smartLink\.eslintrc.config.js`

## Summary
This is an ESLint configuration file for a Vue 3 + TypeScript project within an Nx monorepo workspace called "smartLink". It enforces code quality standards by extending Vue 3, TypeScript, and Prettier configurations, while also implementing Nx-specific module boundary rules to ensure proper dependency management between packages in the monorepo. The configuration applies different linting rules based on file types (TypeScript vs JavaScript) and enforces buildable library dependencies to maintain architectural boundaries.
