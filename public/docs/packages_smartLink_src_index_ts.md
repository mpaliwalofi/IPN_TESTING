**Path**: `packages\smartLink\src\index.ts`

## Summary
This is the main entry point for a Vue plugin that provides a "SmartLink" component for handling intelligent link routing in a design system. The plugin registers the SmartLink component globally and allows configuration options to be injected throughout the application via Vue's provide/inject API, enabling context-aware link behavior (likely distinguishing between internal/external links or different routing strategies).
