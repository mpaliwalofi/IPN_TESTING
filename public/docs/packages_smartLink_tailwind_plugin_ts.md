## Summary
This Tailwind CSS plugin defines utility classes for a "smart-link" component system, providing pre-styled link variants with consistent hover and focus-visible states. It includes five color variants (primary, secondary, tertiary, error, neutral), a disabled state, and specialized button-style link variants (standard and CTA button), each with appropriate styling for text colors, transitions, borders, and layout properties.
