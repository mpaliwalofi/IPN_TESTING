# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `packages\smartLink\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for the "smartLink" package that extends a base configuration and specifies which files should be included in the TypeScript compilation process. It includes Vue component files, TypeScript source files, auto-generated type definitions, Vue shims, and tailwind-related files from the package's source directories. This configuration enables TypeScript type checking and compilation for a Vue.js-based smartLink feature module within a larger monorepo structure.
