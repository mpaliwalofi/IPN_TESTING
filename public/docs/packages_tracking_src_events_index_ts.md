**Path**: `packages\tracking\src\events\index.ts`

## Summary
This is a barrel export file that re-exports tracking event-related functionality, specifically user data tracking capabilities, from the `trackingUserData` module. It serves as a centralized entry point for the events subdirectory within the tracking package, allowing consumers to import event-related tracking utilities through a single, clean interface rather than importing from individual module files.
