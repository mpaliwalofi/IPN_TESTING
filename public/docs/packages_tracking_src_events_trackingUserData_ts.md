## Summary
This TypeScript file defines the data structure and constants for tracking user information in an analytics/tracking system. It establishes three key user attributes (status, type, and subscription state) as constant enums and exports a `ITrackingUserData` interface that standardizes how user data should be structured for tracking events, including user ID, connection status (Connected/Non-connected), user type (Guest/New client/Old client), and subscription status.

## Interfaces
- `ITrackingUserData`

## Type Aliases
- `TUserStatus`
- `TUserType`
- `TUserSubscribed`
