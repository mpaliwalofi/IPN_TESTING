# index.ts

**Path**: `packages\tracking\src\index.ts`

## Summary
This is the main entry point (barrel export) for a tracking package that consolidates and re-exports functionality from two modules: 'events' and 'pixie'. It serves as a convenience layer to allow consumers to import tracking-related functionality from a single location rather than requiring direct imports from individual submodules.
