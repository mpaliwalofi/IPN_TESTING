## Summary
This file serves as a barrel export module for Pixie-related tracking functionality, re-exporting enumerations and type definitions from sibling modules. It provides a centralized entry point for consumers to import Pixie tracking types and enums without needing to know the internal file structure. Pixie appears to be a tracking/analytics component within the larger tracking package.
