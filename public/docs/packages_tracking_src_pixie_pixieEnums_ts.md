## Summary
This file defines TypeScript constant enumerations for a tracking/analytics system called "Pixie". It exports three sets of string constants that categorize different types of tracking events (like exit intent, page views, cart views), action types (like A/B tests, banners, popups), and specific popup variants (like country walls, exit popups, language switchers), which are likely used throughout the application to maintain consistency when logging user interactions and triggering marketing actions.
