## Summary
This TypeScript file defines type definitions for the Pixie tracking/marketing system, which appears to manage dynamic campaign-based UI elements and promotional content. It specifies the structure for Pixie events, actions, and their responses, including configuration types for layout components (top headers, bottom banners) and advertising elements (product offers with promotion codes and tracking data). The types enable type-safe communication between the application and what is likely an external Pixie campaign management service, defining how campaign configurations control visible promotional UI elements across desktop and mobile views.
