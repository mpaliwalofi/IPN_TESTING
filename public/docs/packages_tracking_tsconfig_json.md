# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `packages\tracking\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for a tracking package that configures the TypeScript compiler to compile source files from the `src` directory while excluding test files and dependencies. It uses ES2015 module syntax with bundler module resolution, indicating this package is likely designed to be consumed by a modern bundler (like Webpack, Rollup, or Vite) as part of a monorepo architecture. The configuration enables tracking-related functionality to be compiled into distributable JavaScript modules for client-side or server-side tracking implementations.
