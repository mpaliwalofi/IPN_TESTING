# package.json

**Path**: `packages\types\package.json`

## Summary
This is a package configuration file for a private, shared TypeScript types package (`@ultrapremiumdirect/types`) within a monorepo. It defines build scripts using `unbuild` and exports TypeScript type definitions and ES modules from a central types package, with dependencies on `markdown-it` for markdown processing types. The package serves as a common type definitions library that can be consumed by other packages in the ultrapremiumdirect project.
