# project.json

**Path**: `packages\types\project.json`

## Summary
This is an Nx workspace configuration file for a "types" package, which defines a types-only library project within a monorepo structure. The configuration specifies the project's source root location and sets up a linting target using ESLint with auto-fix enabled. This package likely serves as a shared TypeScript type definitions library used by other packages in the workspace to ensure type consistency across the application.
