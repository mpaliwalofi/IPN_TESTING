## Summary
This is a TypeScript module barrel file that serves as the central export point for CMS (Content Management System) type definitions. It aggregates and re-exports types from multiple Strapi-related modules, including shared types, composite page structures, entity definitions, object types, and API response formats, providing a unified interface for consuming Strapi CMS data throughout the application.
