# breadcrumb.ts

**Path**: `packages\types\src\cms\shared\breadcrumb.ts`

## Summary
This TypeScript file defines type interfaces for a breadcrumb navigation component in a CMS system. It exports two interfaces: `IBreadcrumb` which contains an ID and an array of breadcrumb items, and `IBreadcrumbItem` which represents individual breadcrumb links with optional ID and URL properties along with required display text. These types enable type-safe implementation of hierarchical navigation paths commonly used for showing the user's current location within a website's page structure.

## Interfaces
- `IBreadcrumb`
- `IBreadcrumbItem`
