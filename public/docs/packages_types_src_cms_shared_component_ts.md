## Summary
This TypeScript file defines a type interface for Strapi CMS components, which are reusable content structures in the Strapi headless CMS system. The `IStrapiComponent` interface specifies the required fields (`id` and `__component` identifier) and optional properties (like `enabled` flag) that all Strapi components must have, while allowing additional custom fields through an index signature. This serves as a type definition for ensuring type safety when working with Strapi component data throughout the application.

## Interfaces
- `IStrapiComponent`
