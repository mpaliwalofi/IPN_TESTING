## Summary
This TypeScript file defines type interfaces for a CMS image system with overlay capabilities, likely for an e-commerce platform. It establishes structured types for basic images, relation images, and complex image overlays that can contain various layers (product cards, reviews, CTAs, markdown content, "Made In" badges) with separate desktop and mobile configurations. The types integrate with Strapi CMS entities and support rich product presentation features including ratings, buttons, and customizable typography.
