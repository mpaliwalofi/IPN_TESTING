**Path**: `packages\types\src\cms\shared\index.ts`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript barrel export file that re-exports shared CMS (Content Management System) type definitions and interfaces used across the application. It centralizes access to common CMS component types like breadcrumbs, images, rich content, buttons, links, SEO elements, and various Strapi-specific components, likely used for a headless CMS implementation with Strapi as the backend.
