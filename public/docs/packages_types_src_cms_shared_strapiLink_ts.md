It specifies the structure for configurable links with properties for URL/email targeting, SEO attributes (nofollow), navigation behavior (target_blank), and visual styling imported from a related button component type. The interface serves as a shared type definition for link data structures used across the CMS, enabling consistent link rendering with customizable appearance and behavior.
