**Path**: `packages\types\src\cms\shared\strapiResponsiveText.ts`

## Summary
This TypeScript file defines a type interface for managing responsive text content in a Strapi CMS integration. The `IStrapiResponsiveText` interface allows content to have different text values for desktop and mobile views, enabling device-specific content delivery. This is a common pattern in headless CMS implementations where the same content field needs to display different text based on the user's device or viewport size.
