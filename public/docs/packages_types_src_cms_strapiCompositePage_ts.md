## Summary
This TypeScript file defines the `IStrapiCompositePage` interface, which represents the structure of a composite page content type in a Strapi CMS system. It specifies the data model for pages that include metadata (title, slug, timestamps), SEO elements (opengraph, breadcrumbs), configurable header with call-to-action buttons, and a flexible content area composed of various Strapi components. This type serves as a contract for typed page data retrieved from the Strapi headless CMS across the application.
