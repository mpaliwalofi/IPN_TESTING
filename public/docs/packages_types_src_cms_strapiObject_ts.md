## Summary
This TypeScript file defines a generic interface `IStrapiObject` that serves as a wrapper type for Strapi CMS API responses. It provides type safety for data returned from Strapi, allowing the data property to contain either a single entity or an array of entities that conform to the `IStrapiEntity` interface, which is the standard format for Strapi's REST API responses.
