## Summary
This is a TypeScript barrel export file that re-exports core type definitions from multiple modules including shared types, direction, carousel, and markdown-it related types. It serves as a centralized entry point for importing core type definitions used throughout the application, simplifying import statements and providing a clean public API for the types package's core module.
