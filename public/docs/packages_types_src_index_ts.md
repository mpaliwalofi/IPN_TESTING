# index.ts

**Path**: `packages\types\src\index.ts`

## Summary
This is the main entry point for a TypeScript types package that re-exports type definitions from four domain-specific modules: CMS (content management), core functionality, static content, and utility types. It serves as a centralized barrel export to simplify imports for consumers of this types package, allowing them to import all type definitions from a single location rather than navigating individual module paths.
