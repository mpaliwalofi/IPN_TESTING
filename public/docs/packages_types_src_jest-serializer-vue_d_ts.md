# jest-serializer-vue.d.ts

**Path**: `packages\types\src\jest-serializer-vue.d.ts`

## Summary
This TypeScript declaration file provides type definitions for the 'jest-serializer-vue' module, which is a Jest snapshot serializer for Vue components. It enables TypeScript projects to import and use the jest-serializer-vue package without type errors, allowing for better snapshot testing of Vue components by formatting their output in a more readable way. The file exists to bridge the gap between the JavaScript-based jest-serializer-vue library and TypeScript's type system.
