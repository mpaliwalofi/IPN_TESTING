# index.ts

**Path**: `packages\types\src\utils\index.ts`

## Summary
This is a barrel export file that re-exports all type utilities from the `utilsTypes` module, serving as a centralized entry point for utility types within the types package. It follows a common pattern in TypeScript projects to simplify imports by allowing consumers to import utility types from a single location (`@types/utils`) rather than navigating to specific implementation files.
