# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `packages\types\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for a types package that defines compilation settings for TypeScript source files. It specifies that the package should compile all source files in the `src` directory using ES2015 module format with bundler-style module resolution, while excluding node_modules and test files from compilation. This configuration is typical for a shared types library that will be consumed by other packages in a monorepo or as a standalone type definitions package.
