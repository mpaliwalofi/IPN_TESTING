**Path**: `packages\utils\package.json`

## Summary
This is a package configuration file for a private utility library (`@ultrapremiumdirect/utils`) within a monorepo workspace. It defines a TypeScript-based module that provides shared utility functions, built using `unbuild` to generate ESM output with type definitions. The package depends on shared types from `@ultrapremiumdirect/types` and is designed to be consumed by other packages within the same workspace.
