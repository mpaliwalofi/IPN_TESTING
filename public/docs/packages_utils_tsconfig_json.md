# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `packages\utils\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This is a TypeScript configuration file for a utils package that defines compilation settings and file inclusion rules. It configures the TypeScript compiler to use ES2015 module syntax with bundler-style module resolution, includes all source files from the `src` directory while explicitly excluding `node_modules` and test files. This configuration ensures the utils package is compiled as modern ES modules suitable for bundling in a larger application or library.
