## Summary
# verbatimfullwidth

This package provides LaTeX formatting functionality to display verbatim text (typically code or preformatted content) at full page width, breaking out of the normal text column constraints. It exists to solve the common problem in document preparation where long code lines or wide preformatted content needs to extend beyond standard margin settings without wrapping or being cut off.
