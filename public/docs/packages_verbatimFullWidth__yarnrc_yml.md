# .yarnrc.yml

**Path**: `packages\verbatimFullWidth\.yarnrc.yml`

## Summary
This is a Yarn package manager configuration file that specifies the node linker strategy for the `verbatimFullWidth` package. It configures Yarn to use the traditional `node-modules` linker, which creates a standard `node_modules` directory structure instead of using Yarn's newer Plug'n'Play (PnP) strategy, likely for compatibility reasons with tools that expect conventional node module resolution.
