**Path**: `packages\verbatimFullWidth\package.json`

## Summary
This package configuration defines a Vue 3 component library called `@ultrapremiumdirect/verbatimfullwidth` that provides a full-width verbatim text display component. The package is built as an ES module using Vite, includes TypeScript definitions, and offers both a main component export and an optional Tailwind CSS plugin for styling integration. It's designed as part of a larger design system (upd-ds) for displaying quoted or verbatim content in a full-width layout format.
