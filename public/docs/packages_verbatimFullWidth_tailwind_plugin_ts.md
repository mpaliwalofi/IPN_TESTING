**Path**: `packages\verbatimFullWidth\tailwind\plugin.ts`

## Summary
This Tailwind CSS plugin defines utility classes for full-width verbatim content sections, likely for displaying quotes or testimonials. It provides two components: `.verbatim-full-width` for the container with responsive margins, and `.verbatim-full-width__text` for centered, italicized text styled as primary-colored content with a maximum width constraint. The plugin enables consistent styling of verbatim/quote blocks across the application by encapsulating common layout and typography patterns.
