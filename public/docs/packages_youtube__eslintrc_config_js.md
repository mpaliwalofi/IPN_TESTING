## Summary
This is an ESLint configuration file for a YouTube-related package within an Nx monorepo that uses Vue 3 and TypeScript. It configures linting rules for Vue components, TypeScript, and JavaScript files, while enforcing Nx module boundaries to maintain proper dependency management between packages. The configuration extends Vue 3, TypeScript, and Prettier presets while applying specific Nx workspace rules to ensure buildable library dependencies are properly enforced.
