## Summary
This is a Vue 3 plugin entry point for a YouTube component library. It exports a YouTube component and provides a plugin installer that registers the component globally and optionally injects configuration options into the Vue application. The code serves as the main distribution point for the package, enabling developers to either use the YouTube component directly or install it as a complete Vue plugin with customizable options.
