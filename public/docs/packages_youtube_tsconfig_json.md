# tsconfig.json

**Path**: `packages\youtube\tsconfig.json`

## Summary
This TypeScript configuration file defines the compilation settings for a YouTube-related package within a monorepo structure. It extends a base TypeScript configuration, includes Vue.js source files and type definitions (including Vue shims, auto-imports, and Tailwind CSS), and configures the compiler to support JSON module imports and testing frameworks (Vitest and Testing Library). The configuration establishes the build and type-checking parameters specifically for this YouTube package's development and testing environment.
