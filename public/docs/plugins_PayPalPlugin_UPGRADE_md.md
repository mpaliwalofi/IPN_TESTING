**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\UPGRADE.md`

## Summary
This is an upgrade guide documentation file for the Sylius PayPal Plugin that provides migration instructions between different plugin versions. It details breaking changes across version upgrades, primarily focusing on a route signature change where the PayPal payment form route was modified to require both order token and payment ID parameters instead of just an ID, and notes requirements for upgrading to Sylius 1.8 when moving from 1.0.x to 1.1.0.
