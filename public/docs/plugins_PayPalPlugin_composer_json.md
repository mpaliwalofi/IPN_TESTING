## Summary
This is a Composer configuration file for the PayPal plugin that integrates PayPal payment processing functionality into the Sylius e-commerce framework. It defines the package dependencies, including the core Sylius framework (versions 1.12 or 2.0+), PHP security libraries for payment handling, and database migration tools required for the plugin to function. The file also specifies extensive development dependencies for testing (Behat, PHPUnit), code quality tools (PHPStan, Psalm), and debugging utilities needed for plugin development and maintenance.
