## Summary
This is an EasyCodingStandard (ECS) configuration file for the PayPal plugin that defines PHP code style and quality rules. It imports the base Sylius Labs coding standard and customizes it by skipping specific rules: excluding visibility requirements for test specification files (*Spec.php) and disabling inline documentation variable warnings. This allows the plugin to maintain consistent code formatting while accommodating testing frameworks and practical documentation needs.
