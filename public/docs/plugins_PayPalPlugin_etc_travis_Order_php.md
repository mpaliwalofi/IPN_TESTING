# Order.php

**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\etc\travis\Order.php`

## Summary
This is a test entity class that extends Sylius's core Order model specifically for the PayPal plugin's Travis CI testing environment. It adds a single nullable test field to the base Order entity, likely used to verify database mapping configurations and ORM annotations work correctly in both legacy docblock and modern PHP 8 attribute formats during automated testing.
