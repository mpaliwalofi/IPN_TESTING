**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\phpstan.neon`

## Summary
This is a PHPStan static analysis configuration file for a PayPal payment plugin in a Sylius e-commerce application. It configures PHPStan to ignore specific errors (like undefined repository methods), exclude certain files from analysis (configuration and test files), and includes extensions for Doctrine and Webmozart Assert to improve type checking for those dependencies.
