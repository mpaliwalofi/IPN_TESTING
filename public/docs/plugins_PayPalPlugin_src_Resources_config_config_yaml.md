**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\src\Resources\config\config.yaml`

## Summary
This is a Symfony/Sylius configuration file for PayPal plugin integration that defines payment processing workflows and UI customization. The file primarily configures order item controller routing and contains commented-out sections for state machine callbacks (handling PayPal order completion and refunds), grid customizations (PayPal seller enablement and payout reports), and UI event blocks (PayPal payment buttons on product and cart pages). The configuration establishes the infrastructure for processing PayPal transactions within a Sylius e-commerce platform, though most features are currently disabled.
