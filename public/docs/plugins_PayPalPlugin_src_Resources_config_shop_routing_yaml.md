**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\src\Resources\config\shop_routing.yaml`

## Summary
This is a Symfony routing configuration file for a PayPal payment integration plugin in the Sylius e-commerce platform. The file defines (currently commented-out) HTTP endpoints for the complete PayPal payment workflow, including creating PayPal orders from cart/product pages, processing payments, completing transactions, and updating order information. These routes connect URL paths to their corresponding controller actions that handle the integration between Sylius shop orders and PayPal's payment API.
