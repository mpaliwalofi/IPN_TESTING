# cart.html.twig

**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\src\Resources\views\Buttons\cart.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders PayPal payment buttons specifically for the shopping cart page in a Sylius e-commerce application. It delegates the rendering logic to a dedicated controller action, passing the current cart's ID to generate the appropriate PayPal checkout buttons for that specific order.
