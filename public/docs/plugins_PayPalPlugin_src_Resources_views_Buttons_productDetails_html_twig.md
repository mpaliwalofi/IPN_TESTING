# productDetails.html.twig

**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\src\Resources\views\Buttons\productDetails.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders PayPal payment buttons on a product details page by delegating to a controller action. It passes the current product's ID to the PayPalButtonsController, which handles the logic for displaying appropriate PayPal checkout options specific to that product, enabling direct payment from the product page.
