## Summary
This Twig template renders a "Download Report" button in a grid interface for PayPal payment gateways. It conditionally displays the button only when the gateway is configured as a PayPal gateway (`sylius.pay_pal`) and has SFTP credentials (username and password) set up for accessing PayPal reports.
