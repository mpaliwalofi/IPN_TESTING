# enablePayPal.html.twig

**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\src\Resources\views\Grid\enablePayPal.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a "Enable PayPal" button in the Sylius admin payment methods grid when PayPal is not already enabled. It checks the current page results to determine if PayPal payment method exists, and if not, displays a floating yellow button that links to the payment method creation page specifically for PayPal with a consent confirmation dialog.
