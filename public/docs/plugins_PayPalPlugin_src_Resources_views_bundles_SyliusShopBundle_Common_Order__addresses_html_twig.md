## Summary
This Twig template renders the billing and shipping addresses for an order in the Sylius e-commerce checkout process, specifically customized for the PayPal plugin. It displays the billing address in a responsive grid layout, conditionally shows the shipping address if the order requires shipping, and includes a PayPal-specific notification message when the billing address is missing from the order.
