## Summary
This is a Twig template that renders the order confirmation "Thank You" page after a customer completes a purchase in a Sylius e-commerce shop with PayPal integration. It displays a success message, shows payment instructions if available for the last payment method used, and provides action buttons for logged-in users to view their order or for guest users to change payment methods (if payment isn't completed) or register an account post-checkout.
