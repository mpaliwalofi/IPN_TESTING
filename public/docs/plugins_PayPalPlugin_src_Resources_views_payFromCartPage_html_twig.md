**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\src\Resources\views\payFromCartPage.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a PayPal Smart Payment Button integration for cart checkout in a Sylius e-commerce system. It loads the PayPal SDK with specific configuration (currency, locale, disabled payment methods) and implements the payment flow by creating PayPal orders from the cart, handling payment approval/completion, cancellation, and error scenarios through various backend API endpoints. The template serves as the frontend interface for PayPal payment processing, managing the complete transaction lifecycle from order creation to payment confirmation.
