# payFromProductPage.html.twig

**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\src\Resources\views\payFromProductPage.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template implements PayPal's "Buy Now" button functionality directly on product pages, allowing customers to purchase products without going through the standard checkout flow. It integrates the PayPal SDK to create orders from product page form data, handles the payment approval process, and manages order state transitions through various API endpoints for creating, processing, updating, and canceling PayPal orders.
