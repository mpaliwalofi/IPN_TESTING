## Summary
This Twig template conditionally displays a "Secured by PayPal" logo image when the payment gateway configuration's factory name is set to 'sylius.pay_pal'. It serves as a trust badge in the Sylius e-commerce platform's checkout or payment selection interface to indicate PayPal as an available and secure payment method.
