**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\src\Resources\views\stylesheets.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template file serves as a stylesheet inclusion component for the PayPal plugin in a Sylius e-commerce application. It loads the plugin's CSS file (`style.css`) using Symfony's asset function to properly resolve the path to the bundled stylesheet resources. This template is likely included in layout files to ensure PayPal-specific styling is applied across relevant pages in the shop.
