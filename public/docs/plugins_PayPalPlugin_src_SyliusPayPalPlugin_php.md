# SyliusPayPalPlugin.php

**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\src\SyliusPayPalPlugin.php`

## Summary
This is the main bundle class for the Sylius PayPal Plugin, which integrates PayPal payment functionality into the Sylius e-commerce platform. It extends Symfony's Bundle class and uses the SyliusPluginTrait to register itself as a Sylius plugin, enabling the framework to recognize and load PayPal payment gateway features. This serves as the entry point for the plugin's dependency injection configuration, services, and routing within the Sylius application.
