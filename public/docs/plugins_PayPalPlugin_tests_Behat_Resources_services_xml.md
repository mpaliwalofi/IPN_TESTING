## Summary
This Symfony service configuration file defines Behat test context services for the PayPal plugin's automated testing suite. It registers test contexts for admin-level functionality including managing orders and payment methods, along with a custom UI element for downloading PayPal reports. These services enable behavior-driven development (BDD) testing of PayPal integration features within a Sylius e-commerce platform.
