**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\tests\DataFixtures\ORM\resources\new_order.yaml`

## Summary
This YAML fixture file defines test data for a PayPal payment order in the Sylius e-commerce system. It creates a complete order structure including a new order with "completed" checkout state, associated order items (SW mug with 2 units), and a PayPal payment of $40 USD in "new" state. The fixture is used for testing PayPal plugin integration with Sylius orders, providing a realistic order scenario with customer, channel, and payment method references.
