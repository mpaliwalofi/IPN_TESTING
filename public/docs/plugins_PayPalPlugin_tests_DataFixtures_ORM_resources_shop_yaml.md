**Path**: `plugins\PayPalPlugin\tests\DataFixtures\ORM\resources\shop.yaml`

## Summary
This YAML file defines test fixtures for the PayPal plugin, creating sample e-commerce data for Sylius (an e-commerce framework). It sets up a complete shop environment including a "Mug" product with two variants (Star Wars and Lord of the Rings mugs), pricing information, a web sales channel, currency (USD), locale (en_US), and a test customer (Oliver Queen), enabling integration testing of PayPal payment functionality within a realistic shop context.
