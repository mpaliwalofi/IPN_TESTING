This test class verifies the PayPal order creation functionality in the Sylius PayPal plugin. It tests that when a POST request is made to the create-pay-pal-order endpoint with a payment token, the system successfully creates a PayPal order and returns the expected order data including the PayPal order ID and processing status. This ensures the integration between Sylius e-commerce platform and PayPal's payment processing works correctly during checkout.
