## Summary
This YAML file defines English translation strings for the Payzen payment gateway plugin configuration form in Sylius. It provides user-friendly labels for various Payzen payment gateway settings including authentication credentials (site ID, certificate, REST API keys), operational modes (CTX mode, debug), and installment payment configuration (N times payment, count, period). The translations enable administrators to properly configure the Payzen payment integration within the Sylius e-commerce platform's admin interface.
