## Summary
This is a Psalm static analysis configuration file for a PHP project, set to error level 6 with a baseline for existing issues. It analyzes the `src/` directory while excluding entities, fixtures, configuration, and test files, and enforces code quality by forbidding debug functions like `var_dump` and `dd` while suppressing specific issue types related to parameter typing and template parameters.
