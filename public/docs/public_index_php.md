# index.php

**Path**: `public\index.php`

## Summary
This is the front controller entry point for a Symfony web application that bootstraps and handles all incoming HTTP requests. It initializes the application environment, configures debugging and security settings (trusted proxies/hosts), then creates a Kernel instance to process requests and send responses back to the client. This file serves as the single point of entry for the public-facing web application, routing all requests through Symfony's request/response lifecycle.
