## Summary
This is a PHPSpec test specification file for the `CreateCancelledCustomerSession` use case, which handles the creation of cancelled customer sessions in the TalonOne promotion management system. The spec verifies that the use case can properly construct and send requests to cancel customer sessions (likely when orders are cancelled), working with order entities, promotion coupons, and the TalonOne integration client to update session states to 'cancelled'.
