## Summary
This class serves as a Data Transfer Object (DTO) or Activity object that encapsulates the data needed to change the payment method associated with a subscription. It captures the subscription being modified along with both the previous and new payment instruments, providing a complete audit trail of the payment method change operation. This structure is likely used in a command/activity pattern to pass payment update information between different layers of the subscription management system.
