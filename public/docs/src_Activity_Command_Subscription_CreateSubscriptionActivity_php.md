## Summary
This is a Data Transfer Object (DTO) or Command object that encapsulates the data needed to create a subscription in the system. It serves as a message or activity payload in a command-based architecture (likely CQRS or workflow pattern), carrying a `Subscription` entity to be processed by a corresponding command handler. The class acts as a type-safe wrapper for subscription creation operations, ensuring that all necessary data is bundled together when initiating the subscription creation workflow.
