# DebitSubscriptionActivity.php

**Path**: `src\Activity\Command\Subscription\DebitSubscriptionActivity.php`

## Summary
This class is a Data Transfer Object (DTO) that represents a subscription debit activity command in a subscription billing system. It encapsulates the result of a subscription payment attempt, storing the subscription and order identifiers, the success status of the debit operation, and an optional reason (likely for failure cases). This appears to be used in a CQRS/Event-driven architecture to communicate subscription payment processing outcomes between different parts of the application.
