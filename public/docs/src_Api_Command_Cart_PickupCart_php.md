**Path**: `src\Api\Command\Cart\PickupCart.php`

## Summary
The `PickupCart` class is a command/DTO that represents a request to retrieve or initialize a shopping cart in a Sylius e-commerce application. It captures the essential context needed for cart operations: the channel (store/sales channel), locale (language/region), and customer identification, with attributes ensuring these values are properly populated from the current request context. This command serves as a data transfer object for cart pickup operations, likely used when a customer accesses their existing cart or creates a new one.
