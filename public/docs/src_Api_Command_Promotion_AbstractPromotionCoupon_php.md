# AbstractPromotionCoupon.php

**Path**: `src\Api\Command\Promotion\AbstractPromotionCoupon.php`

## Summary
This abstract class serves as a base data transfer object (DTO) for promotion coupon commands in an e-commerce system. It encapsulates the core attributes of a promotional coupon including the promotion code, optional unique coupon code, usage constraints (total and per-customer limits), expiration date, and a flag to control whether coupons can be reused after order cancellations. This abstraction provides a common structure for concrete coupon command classes (likely for create/update operations) to extend.
