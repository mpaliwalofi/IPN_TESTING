# AddItemToSubscription.php

**Path**: `src\Api\Command\Subscription\AddItemToSubscription.php`

## Summary
This is a command object (likely part of a CQRS pattern) that encapsulates the data required to add a product variant item to an existing subscription. It carries three pieces of information: the subscription identifier, the product variant to be added, and a flag indicating whether the item should be spread across draft orders, enabling modification of subscription contents in the system's subscription management domain.
