## Summary
This class represents a command for creating a new comment on a subscription within the application's API layer. It extends `AbstractSubscriptionComment` to inherit common comment properties and is marked with the `SubscriptionCodeAware` attribute to indicate it requires or handles subscription code context. The class serves as a data transfer object (DTO) in a command-based architecture, likely used with a command bus pattern to handle subscription comment creation operations.
