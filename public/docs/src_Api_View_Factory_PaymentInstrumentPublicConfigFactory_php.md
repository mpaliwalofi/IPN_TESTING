**Path**: `src\Api\View\Factory\PaymentInstrumentPublicConfigFactory.php`

## Summary
This factory class creates `PaymentInstrumentPublicConfig` view objects that wrap payment instrument entities with their public-facing configuration data. It serves as a controlled way to expose only the public subset of payment instrument configuration to API consumers, separating sensitive internal configuration from data that can be safely shared externally.
