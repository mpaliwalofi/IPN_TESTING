## Summary
This class serves as a command object for triggering email notifications when a subscription product becomes unavailable. It is part of a CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) pattern implementation, specifically handling the business event of notifying users via email about product unavailability in their subscriptions. The empty class likely acts as a data transfer object (DTO) or marker that will be handled by a corresponding command handler to execute the email sending logic.
