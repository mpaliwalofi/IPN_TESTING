**Path**: `src\CQRS\Command\SubscriptionOrder\CreateSubscriptionOrder.php`

## Summary
This class represents a CQRS command for creating a new subscription order in the system. It extends `AbstractSubscriptionCommand`, inheriting shared subscription-related properties and behavior while serving as a specific command object that encapsulates the intent and data needed to create a subscription order. In a CQRS architecture, this command would be dispatched to a corresponding handler that executes the business logic for subscription order creation.
