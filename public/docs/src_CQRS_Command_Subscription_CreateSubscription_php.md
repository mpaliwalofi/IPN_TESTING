# CreateSubscription.php

**Path**: `src\CQRS\Command\Subscription\CreateSubscription.php`

## Summary
This class represents a CQRS command for creating a new subscription in the system. It extends `AbstractTokenValueCommand`, indicating it likely carries subscription data (possibly including a token identifier and value/amount) that will be processed by a corresponding command handler to persist a new subscription entity. The command serves as a data transfer object in the CQRS pattern to encapsulate the subscription creation request.
