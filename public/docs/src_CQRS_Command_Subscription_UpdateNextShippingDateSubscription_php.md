# UpdateNextShippingDateSubscription.php

**Path**: `src\CQRS\Command\Subscription\UpdateNextShippingDateSubscription.php`

## Summary
This class represents a CQRS command for updating the next shipping date of a subscription in an e-commerce or subscription management system. It extends `AbstractSubscriptionCommand`, inheriting common subscription-related command properties (likely subscription ID and related data) while serving as a specific intent marker for scheduling operations. The empty implementation suggests the command acts purely as a data transfer object (DTO) that carries the necessary information for handlers to process next shipping date updates.
