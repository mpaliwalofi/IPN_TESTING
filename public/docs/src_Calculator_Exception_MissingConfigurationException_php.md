**Path**: `src\Calculator\Exception\MissingConfigurationException.php`

## Summary

It extends PHP's RuntimeException to provide a specific exception type that can be caught and handled separately from other runtime errors, allowing the application to distinguish between missing configuration issues and other types of failures in the calculator functionality.
