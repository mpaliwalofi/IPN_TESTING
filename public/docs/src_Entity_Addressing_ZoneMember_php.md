**Path**: `src\Entity\Addressing\ZoneMember.php`

## Summary
This class represents a member entity of a geographical zone in the Sylius e-commerce framework's addressing system. It extends the base Sylius ZoneMember model to allow for application-specific customization while maintaining the core functionality for defining zone membership (such as countries, provinces, or other zones that belong to a parent zone). The entity is mapped to the `sylius_zone_member` database table and serves as part of the zone-based addressing and taxation/shipping calculation system.
