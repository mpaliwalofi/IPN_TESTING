**Path**: `src\Entity\Currency\ExchangeRate.php`

## Summary
This class defines a Doctrine ORM entity for storing currency exchange rates in the application's database. It extends Sylius e-commerce framework's base ExchangeRate model to inherit currency conversion functionality while mapping it to the `sylius_exchange_rate` database table, enabling the system to track and manage exchange rates between different currencies for multi-currency support.
