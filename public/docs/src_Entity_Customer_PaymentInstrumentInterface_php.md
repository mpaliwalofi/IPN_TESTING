# PaymentInstrumentInterface.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Customer\PaymentInstrumentInterface.php`

## Summary
This file defines a marker interface for payment instruments in the customer domain. It serves as a base contract that different payment method types (such as credit cards, bank accounts, or digital wallets) would implement, enabling polymorphic handling of various payment instruments throughout the application. The empty interface suggests it's used primarily for type-hinting and ensuring all payment instrument entities share a common type hierarchy.
