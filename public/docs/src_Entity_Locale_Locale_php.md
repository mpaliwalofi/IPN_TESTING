# Locale.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Locale\Locale.php`

## Summary
This class represents a Locale entity for managing localization/internationalization in a Sylius-based e-commerce application. It extends Sylius's base Locale model and exposes locale data through a GraphQL API with query collection capabilities, while supporting search and ordering filters. The entity is mapped to the `sylius_locale` database table and provides read-only API access (no mutation operations defined) to available language/regional locales in the system.
