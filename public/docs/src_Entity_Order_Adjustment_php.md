# Adjustment.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Order\Adjustment.php`

## Summary
This class extends Sylius's base Adjustment entity to represent financial adjustments (discounts, fees, charges) applied to orders in an e-commerce system. It adds two custom adjustment types specific to the business domain: "UpSell" for additional product offerings and "Subscription" for recurring payment adjustments, while inheriting core adjustment functionality like amount calculation and order association from the Sylius framework.
