# OrderSequence.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Order\OrderSequence.php`

## Summary
This class extends Sylius's base OrderSequence component to manage the sequential numbering/ordering of orders in the e-commerce system. It serves as a Doctrine entity that tracks and generates unique order numbers or maintains order sequence state, mapped to the `sylius_order_sequence` database table. The empty implementation indicates it uses the parent class's functionality without requiring additional customization.
