# ProductAssociationTypeTranslation.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Product\ProductAssociationTypeTranslation.php`

## Summary
This class represents a translation entity for product association types in a Sylius e-commerce application, allowing association type names and descriptions to be stored in multiple languages. It extends Sylius's base translation model and maps to the `sylius_product_association_type_translation` database table using Doctrine ORM. The class enables internationalization (i18n) of product relationship types (e.g., "related products", "cross-sells") so they can be displayed in different locales throughout the application.
