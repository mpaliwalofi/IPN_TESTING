# ProductAssociation.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Product\ProductAssociation.php`

## Summary
This class defines a Doctrine ORM entity for managing product associations in a Sylius-based e-commerce application. It extends the base Sylius ProductAssociation model to enable relationships between products (such as "related products," "accessories," or "cross-sells") and maps it to the `sylius_product_association` database table. The empty implementation indicates it uses all default functionality from the Sylius framework while allowing for future customization if needed.
