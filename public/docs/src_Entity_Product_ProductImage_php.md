## Summary
This class defines a Product Image entity for a Sylius e-commerce application, extending the framework's base `ProductImage` class to represent images associated with products. It maps to the `sylius_product_image` database table using Doctrine ORM and serves as a domain model for managing product visual assets within the catalog system. The empty class body indicates it currently uses all inherited functionality without custom modifications, acting as a concrete implementation of Sylius's product image management.
