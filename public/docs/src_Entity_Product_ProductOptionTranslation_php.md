**Path**: `src\Entity\Product\ProductOptionTranslation.php`

## Summary
This class extends Sylius's base ProductOptionTranslation to provide translation capabilities for product options (e.g., size, color) in an e-commerce application. It serves as a Doctrine ORM entity that stores localized text for product option attributes, enabling multi-language support for product configuration options. The class acts as a domain-specific extension point, allowing the application to customize translation behavior while leveraging Sylius's commerce framework.
