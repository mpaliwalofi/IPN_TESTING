# ProductReview.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Product\ProductReview.php`

## Summary
This class defines a custom ProductReview entity for the application's product catalog system, extending Sylius e-commerce framework's base ProductReview model. It represents customer reviews and ratings for products, storing them in the `sylius_product_review` database table. The empty implementation allows for future customization of review functionality while inheriting standard review features (rating, comment, author, status) from the Sylius framework.
