# ProductVariantTranslation.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Product\ProductVariantTranslation.php`

## Summary
This class extends Sylius's base product variant translation entity to provide multi-language support for product variant attributes (like size, color variations) in an e-commerce application. It serves as a Doctrine ORM entity mapped to the `sylius_product_variant_translation` database table, enabling storage of localized content such as variant names and descriptions. The empty class body indicates it currently uses all inherited translation functionality without custom modifications.
