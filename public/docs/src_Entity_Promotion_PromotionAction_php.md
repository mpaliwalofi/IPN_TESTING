# PromotionAction.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Promotion\PromotionAction.php`

## Summary
This entity class represents a promotion action in an e-commerce system built with Sylius, defining the specific actions that should be executed when a promotion's rules are satisfied (e.g., apply discount, give free shipping). It extends Sylius's base `PromotionAction` model and configures it as an auditable Doctrine entity with GraphQL API access through ApiPlatform, supporting query operations for retrieving promotion actions but disabling REST endpoints.
