# PromotionRule.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Promotion\PromotionRule.php`

## Summary
This class defines a `PromotionRule` entity that extends Sylius's base promotion rule functionality to represent business rules that determine when promotions should be applied (e.g., minimum order amount, specific products). It configures the entity with Doctrine ORM mapping, audit tracking capabilities, and exposes GraphQL query operations through API Platform while disabling REST operations.
