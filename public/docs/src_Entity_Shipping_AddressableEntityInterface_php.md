# AddressableEntityInterface.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Shipping\AddressableEntityInterface.php`

## Summary
This interface defines a contract for entities that require shipping and billing address functionality within an e-commerce shipping domain. It mandates that implementing classes must provide methods to retrieve both shipping and billing addresses, using Sylius framework's AddressInterface type. This abstraction allows consistent address handling across different entity types (like orders, shipments, etc.) that need address information for shipping operations.

## Function Details

### `getShippingAddress`
