## Summary
This class defines a Doctrine entity for shipping categories that extends Sylius's base shipping category model. It exposes shipping category data through a GraphQL API with pagination, search, and ordering capabilities while disabling standard REST operations. The entity serves to categorize shipping methods in an e-commerce system, allowing products to be grouped by their shipping requirements.
