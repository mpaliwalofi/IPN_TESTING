## Summary
This entity represents a shipping method rule in a Sylius-based e-commerce system, extending the base Sylius shipping method rule component to define conditions or constraints that determine when a particular shipping method can be applied. It exposes GraphQL query operations (single and collection) through API Platform while disabling REST operations, allowing clients to retrieve shipping rules that govern shipping method eligibility based on criteria like order total, weight, or destination.
