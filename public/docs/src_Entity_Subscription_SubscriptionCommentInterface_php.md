# SubscriptionCommentInterface.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Subscription\SubscriptionCommentInterface.php`

## Summary
This file defines a marker interface for the subscription comment functionality within the application's subscription domain. It serves as a type contract to identify entities or services that handle comments related to subscriptions, enabling type-hinting and polymorphic behavior. The empty interface suggests it's primarily used for type categorization and may be extended with methods in the future or implemented by classes that share common subscription comment behavior.
