# SubscriptionInterface.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Subscription\SubscriptionInterface.php`

## Summary
This file defines a marker interface for subscription entities in the application's domain model. It serves as a type contract that all subscription-related entities must implement, enabling polymorphic handling of different subscription types throughout the codebase. The empty interface currently acts as a placeholder for future common subscription methods or as a type hint for dependency injection and repository patterns.
