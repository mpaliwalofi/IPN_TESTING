**Path**: `src\Entity\Subscription\SubscriptionItemInterface.php`

## Summary
This file defines a marker interface for subscription items within the application's subscription management system. The interface currently contains no methods, serving as a type contract that allows different subscription item implementations to be identified and handled polymorphically. It appears to be part of a subscription billing or plan management domain model where items represent individual components or line items of a subscription.
