# TaxCategory.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Taxation\TaxCategory.php`

## Summary
The `TaxCategory` entity extends Sylius's base tax category model to represent different tax classification categories (e.g., standard rate, reduced rate, zero-rated) for products or services. It adds API Platform integration with GraphQL query collection support and REST API filters (search and ordering) while maintaining the core taxation functionality from the Sylius e-commerce framework. The entity is persisted to the `sylius_tax_category` database table and serves as the foundation for applying appropriate tax rates to taxable items in the system.
