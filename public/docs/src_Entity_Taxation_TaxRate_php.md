# TaxRate.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\Taxation\TaxRate.php`

## Summary
This code defines a custom `TaxRate` entity for the application's taxation system, extending Sylius e-commerce framework's base tax rate model. It serves as a Doctrine ORM entity mapped to the `sylius_tax_rate` database table, allowing the application to store and manage tax rate configurations (such as VAT, sales tax, etc.) while inheriting all standard Sylius tax rate functionality without adding custom modifications.

## Classes
- `TaxRate`
