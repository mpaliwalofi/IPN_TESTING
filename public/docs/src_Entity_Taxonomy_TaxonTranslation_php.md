## Summary
The `TaxonTranslation` class is a Doctrine entity that stores localized/translated content for taxonomic categories (taxons) in a Sylius-based e-commerce application. It extends the base Sylius taxonomy translation model and exposes GraphQL query operations (single item and paginated collection queries) through API Platform, while disabling REST API endpoints, allowing multilingual taxonomy data to be retrieved via GraphQL only.
