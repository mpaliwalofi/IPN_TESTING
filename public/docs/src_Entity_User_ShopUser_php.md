# ShopUser.php

**Path**: `src\Entity\User\ShopUser.php`

## Summary
The `ShopUser` class extends Sylius's base shop user entity to represent customer/shopper accounts in the e-commerce system. It configures the entity to be queryable via GraphQL API (both single items and paginated collections) while disabling REST API operations, and maps it to the `sylius_shop_user` database table using Doctrine ORM.
