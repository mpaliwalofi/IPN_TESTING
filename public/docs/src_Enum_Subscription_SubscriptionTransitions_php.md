# SubscriptionTransitions.php

**Path**: `src\Enum\Subscription\SubscriptionTransitions.php`

## Summary
This enum defines the possible state transitions for a subscription workflow system. It establishes five transition types: GRAPH (likely the main workflow identifier), PAUSE (temporarily suspending a subscription), STOP (terminating it), RESUME (reactivating a paused subscription), and ON_ERROR (handling error states). This appears to be used with a state machine or workflow engine to manage subscription lifecycle events in the application.
