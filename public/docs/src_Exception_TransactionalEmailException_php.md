# TransactionalEmailException.php

**Path**: `src\Exception\TransactionalEmailException.php`

## Summary
This is a custom exception class for handling errors specific to transactional email operations (e.g., order confirmations, password resets, notifications). It extends PHP's base Exception class to provide a distinct exception type that can be caught and handled separately from other application errors, enabling targeted error handling and logging for email-related failures in the application's email delivery system.
