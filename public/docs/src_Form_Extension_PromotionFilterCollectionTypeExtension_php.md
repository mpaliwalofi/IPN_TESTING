# PromotionFilterCollectionTypeExtension.php

**Path**: `src\Form\Extension\PromotionFilterCollectionTypeExtension.php`

## Summary
This Symfony form extension enhances the promotion filter collection system by adding five custom filter types for promotional rules: a subscribable filter, and inclusion/exclusion filters for taxons, products, and product variants. It extends Sylius's core promotion filtering capabilities to provide more granular control over which products and variants qualify for promotional discounts based on various criteria like subscription status and product categorization.
