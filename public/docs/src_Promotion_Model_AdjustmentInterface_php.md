## Summary
This interface extends Sylius's base adjustment interface to define custom adjustment type constants for an e-commerce promotion system. It specifies seven specialized adjustment types including free products, upsells, subscriptions, payment charges with their taxes and promotions, and tax calculations without discounts, which are used to track different types of price modifications applied to orders throughout the application.
