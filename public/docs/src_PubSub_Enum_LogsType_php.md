**Path**: `src\PubSub\Enum\LogsType.php`

## Summary
This PHP enum defines the different types of log categories used in the PubSub messaging system. It establishes four distinct log types (ORDER, CUSTOMER, SUBSCRIPTION, and PROMOTION) that likely serve as classifiers or routing keys for categorizing and organizing log messages related to different business domains within the application's publish-subscribe architecture.
