# OrderRuleConditionRepository.php

**Path**: `src\Repository\Order\OrderRuleConditionRepository.php`

## Summary
This repository class serves as a data access layer for managing order rule conditions in a Sylius-based e-commerce system. It extends Sylius's EntityRepository to provide database operations for retrieving and persisting order promotion/pricing rule conditions that determine when specific rules should be applied to orders. The empty implementation indicates it currently relies entirely on inherited generic repository methods without requiring custom query logic.
