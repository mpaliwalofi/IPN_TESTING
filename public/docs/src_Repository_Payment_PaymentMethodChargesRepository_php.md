**Path**: `src\Repository\Payment\PaymentMethodChargesRepository.php`

## Summary
This is a repository class for managing PaymentMethodCharges entities in a Sylius-based e-commerce application. It extends Sylius's EntityRepository to provide database access methods for payment method charges, which likely represent fees or costs associated with different payment methods. Currently it contains no custom query methods, relying entirely on the inherited base repository functionality for CRUD operations.
