**Path**: `src\Repository\UpSellVariantRepository.php`

## Summary
This repository class serves as a database access layer for managing UpSell product variants in a Sylius e-commerce application. It extends Sylius's EntityRepository to provide standard CRUD operations for upsell variant entities, which are typically used to suggest related or upgraded product variations to customers during the shopping experience. Currently, it relies entirely on inherited functionality without custom query methods.
