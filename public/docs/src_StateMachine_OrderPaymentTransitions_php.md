# OrderPaymentTransitions.php

**Path**: `src\StateMachine\OrderPaymentTransitions.php`

## Summary
This interface extends Sylius's base order payment transitions to add custom payment transition constants for an e-commerce application. It introduces two additional payment transition states: one for handling payment-on-delivery scenarios and another for managing upcoming/scheduled payments, expanding beyond the standard Sylius payment workflow.
