## Summary
This is a Data Transfer Object (DTO) that represents the structure of a legacy subscription record during a subscription migration process. It encapsulates all fields from an old subscription system including order details, billing/shipping information, payment tokens, scheduling data (next shipping dates), subscription state, and failure tracking counters, serving as an intermediate data structure to facilitate migrating subscriptions from an older system to a newer one.
