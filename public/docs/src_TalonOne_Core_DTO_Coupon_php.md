## Summary
This class serves as a Data Transfer Object (DTO) representing a promotional coupon within the Talon.One marketing/promotions platform integration. It encapsulates all essential coupon properties including identification, lifecycle dates (creation, start, expiry), usage tracking (counters for usage, discounts, reservations), campaign association, and redemption limits. The DTO facilitates data exchange between the application and Talon.One's coupon management system, storing both operational metadata and business rules for coupon validation and consumption tracking.
