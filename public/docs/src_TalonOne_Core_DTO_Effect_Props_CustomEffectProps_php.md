**Path**: `src\TalonOne\Core\DTO\Effect\Props\CustomEffectProps.php`

## Summary
This class serves as a Data Transfer Object (DTO) for custom effects in the TalonOne promotion engine integration. It encapsulates properties needed to represent custom promotional effects, including effect identification, positioning information for cart items and bundles, and a flexible payload array for additional effect-specific data. The optional properties for cart item positions and bundle details suggest it handles effects that can be applied at different granularities within a shopping cart structure.
