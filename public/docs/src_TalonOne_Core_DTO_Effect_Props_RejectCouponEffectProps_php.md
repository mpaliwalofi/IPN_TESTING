## Summary
This class is a Data Transfer Object (DTO) that encapsulates the properties of a coupon rejection effect in the TalonOne promotion engine integration. It stores information about why a coupon was rejected, including the coupon value, rejection reason, optional campaign exclusion details, and positional metadata (condition/effect indices) for tracking where in the rule evaluation the rejection occurred. This DTO is used to communicate coupon validation failures from TalonOne's rule engine back to the application.
