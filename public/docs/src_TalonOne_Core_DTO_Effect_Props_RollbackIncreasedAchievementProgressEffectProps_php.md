## Summary
This class is a Data Transfer Object (DTO) that represents the properties of an effect used to rollback (undo) achievement progress in the TalonOne promotion engine. It contains data about which achievement and progress tracker are being rolled back, the amount of progress to decrease, and the current state of progress relative to the target, enabling the system to reverse previously incremented achievement progress when needed (such as during transaction rollbacks or corrections).
