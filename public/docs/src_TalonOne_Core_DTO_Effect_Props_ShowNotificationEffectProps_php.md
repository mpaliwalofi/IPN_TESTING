## Summary
This class is a Data Transfer Object (DTO) that encapsulates the properties needed to display a notification effect within the Talon.One promotional campaign system. It stores three essential notification attributes: the type of notification, its title, and body content, which are likely used when a promotion rule triggers a customer-facing notification. This DTO serves as a structured container for passing notification data between different layers of the Talon.One integration.
