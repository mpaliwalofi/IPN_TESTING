# RedeemReferralEffect.php

**Path**: `src\TalonOne\Core\DTO\Effect\RedeemReferralEffect.php`

## Summary
This class represents a specific type of promotion effect for redeeming referral codes in the Talon.One integration. It extends the base `Effect` class and encapsulates the properties needed to process referral redemptions through the `RedeemReferralEffectProps` object, which likely contains details about the referral being redeemed (referrer, referee, rewards, etc.). This DTO serves as a data structure for handling referral program mechanics when Talon.One's promotion engine triggers a referral redemption action.
