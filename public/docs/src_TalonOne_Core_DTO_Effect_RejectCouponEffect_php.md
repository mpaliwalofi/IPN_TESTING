**Path**: `src\TalonOne\Core\DTO\Effect\RejectCouponEffect.php`

## Summary
This class represents a rejection effect for coupons within the TalonOne promotion engine integration. It extends a base `Effect` class and contains properties specific to coupon rejection scenarios (via `RejectCouponEffectProps`), which would be used when a coupon fails validation or needs to be declined during campaign rule execution. This DTO (Data Transfer Object) serves as a typed container for handling coupon rejection responses from the TalonOne API.
