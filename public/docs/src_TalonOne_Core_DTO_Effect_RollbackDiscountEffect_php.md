# RollbackDiscountEffect.php

**Path**: `src\TalonOne\Core\DTO\Effect\RollbackDiscountEffect.php`

## Summary
This class represents a rollback discount effect in the TalonOne promotion engine integration. It extends the base `Effect` class and encapsulates the properties needed to reverse or undo a previously applied discount through its `RollbackDiscountEffectProps` property. This is used when a discount needs to be removed from a customer's cart or order, typically when promotion conditions are no longer met or when reversing transactions.
