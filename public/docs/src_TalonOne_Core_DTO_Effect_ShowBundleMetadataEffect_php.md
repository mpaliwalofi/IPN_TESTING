## Summary
This class represents a specific type of promotional effect in the Talon.One integration that displays bundle metadata information. It extends the base `Effect` class and contains a `ShowBundleMetadataEffectProps` property to hold the bundle-related data that should be shown to users. This is part of a promotion/campaign system where different effect types trigger different actions, and this particular effect is responsible for surfacing bundle configuration or details.
