## Summary
This class represents a webhook trigger effect in the TalonOne promotion/campaign management system. It extends the base `Effect` class and contains properties specific to webhook triggering operations, encapsulated in the `TriggerWebhookEffectProps` object. This DTO (Data Transfer Object) is used to structure and pass webhook-related effect data when TalonOne's rule engine determines that a webhook should be fired as part of a promotion or campaign action.
