## Summary
This class is a Data Transfer Object (DTO) representing a referral in the Talon.One promotion management system. It encapsulates all the data related to a customer referral campaign, including the referral code, usage tracking (limits and counters), temporal constraints (creation, start, and expiry dates), participant identities (advocate and friend profile IDs), and associated campaign/batch information. The DTO serves as a structured container for transferring referral data between different layers of the application when integrating with Talon.One's referral program functionality.
