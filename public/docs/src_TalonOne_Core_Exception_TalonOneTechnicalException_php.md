## Summary
This file defines a marker interface for technical exceptions in the TalonOne integration layer. It extends the domain-level TalonOneException interface to specifically categorize exceptions that are technical in nature (e.g., API connectivity issues, configuration errors) as opposed to business logic exceptions, enabling different exception handling strategies based on the error type.
