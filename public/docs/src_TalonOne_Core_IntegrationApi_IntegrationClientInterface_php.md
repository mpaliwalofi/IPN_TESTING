# IntegrationClientInterface.php

**Path**: `src\TalonOne\Core\IntegrationApi\IntegrationClientInterface.php`

## Summary
This file defines an empty marker interface for Talon.One integration API clients. It extends the base `TalonOneClientInterface` to provide type differentiation for integration-specific client implementations, likely used to distinguish integration API operations from other Talon.One API types (such as management APIs) within the application's dependency injection or factory patterns.
