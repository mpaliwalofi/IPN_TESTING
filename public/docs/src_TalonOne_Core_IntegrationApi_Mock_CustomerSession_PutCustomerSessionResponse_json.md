## Summary
This JSON file serves as a mock response for testing the Talon.One integration API's customer session update endpoint. It represents a complete promotional engine response showing a closed shopping cart session with applied discount effects, including a coupon code ("DEV-SYLI-TEST") that triggers free shipping and payment fee waivers through campaign rules. The structure demonstrates how the Talon.One promotion system calculates and returns pricing effects, cart details, and campaign rule evaluations for integration testing purposes.
