# IntegrationRequestInterface.php

**Path**: `src\TalonOne\Core\IntegrationApi\Request\IntegrationRequestInterface.php`

## Summary
This file defines a marker interface for Talon.One integration API requests. It extends the base `TalonOneRequestInterface` to provide type differentiation for integration-specific requests within the Talon.One promotional campaign management system, allowing the codebase to distinguish integration API requests from other types of API requests through type hinting and polymorphism.
