# ManagementRequestInterface.php

**Path**: `src\TalonOne\Core\ManagementApi\Request\ManagementRequestInterface.php`

## Summary
This file defines a marker interface for Talon.One management API requests. It extends the base `TalonOneRequestInterface` to create a specific type contract for management-related operations, allowing the application to distinguish management API requests from other types of Talon.One API requests (such as integration or customer-facing requests) through type-hinting and polymorphism.
