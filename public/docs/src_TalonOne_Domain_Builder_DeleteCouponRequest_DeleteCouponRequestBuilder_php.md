## Summary
This is a builder class that constructs API requests for deleting coupons in the TalonOne promotion management system. It follows the Builder pattern to create `DeleteCouponRequest` objects with required identifiers (applicationId, campaignId, couponId), setting empty payload and query parameters since deletion operations typically don't require additional data beyond the resource identifiers in the URL path.
