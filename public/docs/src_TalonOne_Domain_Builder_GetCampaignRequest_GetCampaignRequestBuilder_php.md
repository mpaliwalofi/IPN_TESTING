## Summary
This builder class constructs `GetCampaignRequest` objects for retrieving campaign data from the TalonOne Management API. It implements the builder pattern to create properly configured API requests with the required application ID and campaign ID, while setting empty payload and query parameters since this is a simple GET operation that only needs the identifiers in the request path.
