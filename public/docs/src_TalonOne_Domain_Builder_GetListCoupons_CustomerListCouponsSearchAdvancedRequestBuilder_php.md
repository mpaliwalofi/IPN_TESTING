## Summary
This builder class constructs API requests to search for and retrieve a list of coupons associated with a specific customer from the TalonOne promotion management system. It implements the builder pattern to create `GetListCouponsSearchAdvancedRequest` objects by setting query parameters that filter coupons based on the customer's profile ID (using `recipientIntegrationId`), enabling the application to fetch customer-specific coupon data from TalonOne's Management API.
