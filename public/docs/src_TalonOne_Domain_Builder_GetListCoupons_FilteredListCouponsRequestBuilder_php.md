**Path**: `src\TalonOne\Domain\Builder\GetListCoupons\FilteredListCouponsRequestBuilder.php`

## Summary
This class is a builder for constructing filtered requests to retrieve coupons from the TalonOne marketing platform's Management API. It builds a `GetListCouponsRequest` with extensive query parameters for filtering coupons by various criteria such as validity, redemption status, date ranges (created/expires/starts), recipient information, batch ID, and pagination settings. The builder follows the builder pattern to separate the construction of complex coupon list requests from their representation, enabling filtered retrieval of coupons for a specific application and campaign.
