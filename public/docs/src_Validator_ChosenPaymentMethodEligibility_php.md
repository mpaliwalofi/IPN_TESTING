# ChosenPaymentMethodEligibility.php

**Path**: `src\Validator\ChosenPaymentMethodEligibility.php`

## Summary
This is a Symfony validation constraint class for the Sylius e-commerce platform that ensures a chosen payment method is valid and available for use. It defines two error messages—one for when a payment method is not available and another for when it doesn't exist—and specifies that validation should be performed at the class level by its associated validator (`ChosenPaymentMethodEligibilityValidator`).
