# PasswordNotBlank.php

**Path**: `src\Validator\PasswordNotBlank.php`

## Summary
This class is a custom validation constraint that extends Symfony's `NotBlank` constraint specifically for password fields. It exists to provide a semantically distinct validator for password validation, allowing for password-specific error messages, configuration, or validation logic to be centralized and differentiated from generic "not blank" validation rules in the application's validation layer.
