**Path**: `src\Validator\Promotion\CreatePromotionCoupon.php`

## Summary
This is a Symfony validation constraint class used to validate promotion coupon creation in an e-commerce or promotional system. It defines a class-level constraint that enforces business rules for promotion coupons, specifically checking that the entity is promotion-based and that coupon codes meet minimum length requirements. The constraint contains two validation error messages: one for verifying the entity is a valid promotion coupon type, and another for enforcing code length limits.
