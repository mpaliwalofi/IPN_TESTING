# ShippingMethodConsistency.php

**Path**: `src\Validator\ShippingMethodConsistency.php`

## Summary
This class defines a custom Symfony validation constraint for ensuring consistency between shipping methods and delivery types in an e-commerce/logistics system. It validates at the class level (CLASS_CONSTRAINT) and provides two distinct error messages: one for when a pickup delivery shipping method is expected but not provided, and another for when a home delivery shipping method is expected but not provided.
