# webpack.config.example.js

**Path**: `src\admin\webpack.config.example.js`

## Summary
This is a template/example configuration file for customizing Strapi's admin panel webpack build process. It exports a function that receives the default webpack configuration and webpack instance, allowing developers to modify build settings (such as loaders, plugins, or optimizations) before returning the customized config. This enables advanced users to extend or override Strapi's default admin build behavior without ejecting from the framework.
