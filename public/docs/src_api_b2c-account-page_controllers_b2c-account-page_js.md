## Summary
This is a Strapi controller for managing the B2C account page content, which retrieves and transforms account page data from the CMS. It implements a custom `find` method that deeply populates nested content relationships, sanitizes the entity data, and applies cross-sell transformations before returning the account page configuration to the frontend.
