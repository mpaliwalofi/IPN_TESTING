## Summary
This file defines a router for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) account page content type in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate RESTful API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for managing B2C account page content, enabling frontend applications to retrieve and manipulate account page data through standardized HTTP requests.
