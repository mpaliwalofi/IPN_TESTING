## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a B2C "My Addresses" page content type in French ("Mes Adresses"). It defines a single-type collection with two rich-text headers (for when addresses exist or don't exist) and two dynamic zones (`content` and `no_content`) that can contain various B2C components like address lists, account links, carousels, FAQs, and other page elements. The schema enables content managers to build customizable address management pages with different layouts depending on whether the user has saved addresses or not.
