## Summary
This Strapi controller manages the B2C (business-to-consumer) addresses page content type, serving as an API endpoint that retrieves and formats address page data for customer-facing applications. It extends the default Strapi controller with custom logic to deeply populate nested relationships, handle both "content" and "no_content" sections, and apply cross-sell transformations to enrich the response data with related product recommendations or promotional content.
