## Summary
This file creates a standard Strapi router for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) addresses page content type. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate RESTful API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for managing customer address page content, likely including address form fields, validation rules, and display configuration for the customer-facing addresses management interface.
