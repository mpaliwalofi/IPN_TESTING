## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS controller for a B2C animal page that retrieves and transforms single-type content entities. It extends the core controller to fetch animal page data with deep population of related fields, applies content-specific population strategies, sanitizes the output, and enriches the response with cross-sell product transformations before returning it to the client.
