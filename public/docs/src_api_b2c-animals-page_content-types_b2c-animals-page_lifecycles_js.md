## Summary
This lifecycle hook file automatically triggers localization of Akeneo product data whenever a B2C animals page content entry is created or updated in Strapi. It serves as an integration point between the CMS content management and the Akeneo PIM system, ensuring that product translations/localizations are synchronized after content changes to animals pages.
