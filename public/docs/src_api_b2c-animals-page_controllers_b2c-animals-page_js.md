## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS controller for the B2C animals page that retrieves and transforms page content data. It handles fetching a single-type entity with deep population of related content fields, sanitizes the output, and applies cross-sell transformations to both main content and no_content sections before returning the response. The controller is designed to deliver fully populated page data for a customer-facing animals information page in a B2C e-commerce context.
