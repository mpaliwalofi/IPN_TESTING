## Summary
This code implements lifecycle hooks for a B2C cart page content type in Strapi CMS. It automatically triggers localization of content via the Akeneo import plugin's localizer service whenever a cart page entry is created or updated, ensuring that product/content data stays synchronized and properly localized across different language versions.
