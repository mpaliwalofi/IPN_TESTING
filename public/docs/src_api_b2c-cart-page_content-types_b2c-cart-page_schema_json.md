## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a B2C shopping cart page ("Panier" means "Cart" in French) content type. It defines a single-type content model with internationalization support and two dynamic zone fields: one for displaying content when items are in the cart (`content`) and another for empty cart states (`content_no_cart`), both supporting a wide variety of reusable UI components like carousels, cross-sells, FAQs, and cart-specific elements.
