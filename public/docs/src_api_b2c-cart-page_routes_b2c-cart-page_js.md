## Summary
This file creates a RESTful API router for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) cart page content type in a Strapi headless CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory function to automatically generate standard CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete) for managing cart page content, enabling frontend applications to fetch and manipulate cart page data through the API.
