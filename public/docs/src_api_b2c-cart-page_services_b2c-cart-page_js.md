## Summary
This file defines a Strapi CMS service for managing the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) cart page content type. It creates a standard Strapi core service using the factory pattern, which provides default CRUD operations and content management functionality for the b2c-cart-page API endpoint. This service acts as the business logic layer between the cart page's API routes and the underlying database, enabling content editors to manage shopping cart page content through Strapi's admin interface.
