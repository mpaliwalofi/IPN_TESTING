## Summary
This code defines a Strapi service for managing B2C (Business-to-Consumer) category entities. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate standard CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) for the b2c-category content type, providing the business logic layer between the API controllers and the database for organizing B2C products or content into categories.
