## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema configuration for a B2C contact page singleton content type. It defines a localizable, draft-enabled page structure with OpenGraph metadata, an LLM component, and a flexible dynamic zone that can include 40+ different content components (contact forms, carousels, FAQs, hero sections, etc.). The schema enables content managers to build customized contact pages by assembling various pre-defined UI components while supporting internationalization across multiple locales.
