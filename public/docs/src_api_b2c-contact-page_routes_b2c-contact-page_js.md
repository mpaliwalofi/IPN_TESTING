## Summary
This file defines a Strapi API router for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) contact page content type. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate standard RESTful CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete) for managing contact page content in a customer-facing website or application. The router enables API access to retrieve and modify contact page information such as forms, contact details, or messaging content for B2C interactions.
