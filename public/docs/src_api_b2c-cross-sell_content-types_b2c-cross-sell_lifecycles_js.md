## Summary
This lifecycle hooks module for the b2c-cross-sell content type automatically triggers product localization whenever a cross-sell record is created or updated. It integrates with the import-akeneo plugin's localizer service to ensure cross-sell data is properly synchronized and localized across different language versions after any data changes.
