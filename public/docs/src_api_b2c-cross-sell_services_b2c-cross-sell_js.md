## Summary
This file defines a Strapi service for managing B2C (business-to-consumer) cross-sell functionality, which likely handles product recommendations or related item suggestions to customers during their shopping experience. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to create a standard CRUD service with default methods for querying, creating, updating, and deleting cross-sell product associations or recommendations in the e-commerce system.
