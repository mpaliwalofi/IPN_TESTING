## Summary
This lifecycle hook file triggers product localization after creating or updating B2C sample (échantillon) content entries. It automatically invokes the Akeneo import plugin's localization service to ensure product data is properly localized across different languages/regions whenever sample records are modified in the Strapi CMS.
