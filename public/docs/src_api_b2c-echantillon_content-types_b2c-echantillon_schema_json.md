## Summary
This Strapi CMS schema defines a B2C product sample ("echantillon") collection type for an e-commerce system. It configures a multilingual content type with attributes for SKU, product title, images, slugs, OpenGraph metadata, and multiple product descriptions, supporting draft/publish workflow and internationalization (i18n). The schema serves as the data model for managing product sample information across different languages in a business-to-consumer context.
