## Summary
This code creates a Strapi CMS service for managing B2C sample ("échantillon" means sample in French) data. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to generate a core service with standard CRUD operations for the b2c-echantillon content type, which likely handles business-to-consumer product samples or specimen management in an e-commerce context.
