## Summary
This schema defines a Strapi CMS content type for a B2C FAQ page with singleton behavior (only one instance allowed). It configures various FAQ-specific fields including OpenGraph metadata, FAQ indexing settings, and a flexible dynamic zone content area that supports 40+ different component types ranging from search functionality and FAQs to carousels, CTAs, and rich content blocks. The schema enables content editors to build customizable FAQ pages with draft/publish workflow support.
