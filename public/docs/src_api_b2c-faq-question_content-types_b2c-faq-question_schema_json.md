## Summary
This JSON schema defines a Strapi content type for B2C (Business-to-Consumer) FAQ questions with internationalization support. It structures FAQ entries with a question field, auto-generated slug, rich-text response, relation to FAQ subjects (many questions can belong to one subject), and includes LLM (Large Language Model) component integration for AI-enhanced functionality. The schema enables draft/publish workflow and localization across multiple languages for all text content.
