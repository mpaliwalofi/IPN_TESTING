## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a B2C FAQ subject collection type that organizes frequently asked questions by topic. It defines a localized content structure with attributes including a title, URL slug, icon (from predefined categories like delivery, payment, subscription), and establishes one-to-many relationships with both B2C and mobile FAQ question collections. The schema supports draft/publish workflow, internationalization (i18n), OpenGraph metadata for SEO, and includes LLM component integration for AI-powered features.
