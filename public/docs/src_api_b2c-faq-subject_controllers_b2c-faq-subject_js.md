## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS controller for managing B2C (business-to-consumer) FAQ subject entities. It provides two main endpoints: a standard `find` method that retrieves multiple FAQ subjects with populated OpenGraph metadata, and a custom `findSlug` method that fetches a single FAQ subject by either its slug (string) or numeric ID, with deep population of related fields for rendering detailed FAQ category pages.
