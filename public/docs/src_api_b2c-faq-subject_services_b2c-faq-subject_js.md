**Path**: `src\api\b2c-faq-subject\services\b2c-faq-subject.js`

## Summary
This code creates a Strapi CMS service for managing B2C (Business-to-Consumer) FAQ subjects, which likely represent categories or topics for organizing frequently asked questions. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to generate a core service with standard CRUD operations for the 'b2c-faq-subject' content type. This service acts as the business logic layer between the API routes and the database for managing FAQ subject data in a customer-facing FAQ system.
