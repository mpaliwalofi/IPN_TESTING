## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema configuration file that defines a single-type content structure for B2C (Business-to-Consumer) feed management. The schema specifies a localized content type with two main components: feed samples and feed attributes, both supporting internationalization (i18n) without draft/publish workflow. It serves as the data model definition for managing product or content feeds in a B2C e-commerce or content delivery system.
