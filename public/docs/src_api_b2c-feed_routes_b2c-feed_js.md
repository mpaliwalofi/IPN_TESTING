## Summary
This file defines a standard Strapi router for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) feed API endpoint. It creates a core router using Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate RESTful routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for managing B2C feed content, enabling CRUD operations on feed data that is likely consumed by customer-facing applications.
