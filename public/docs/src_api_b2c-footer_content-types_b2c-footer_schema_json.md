## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a B2C website footer content type. It defines a localized, single-instance content structure containing promotional banners (desktop/mobile variants with rich text), USP lists, CTA buttons, and multiple link sections (information, services, and brand links). The schema enables content managers to configure all footer elements through the CMS with internationalization support across different locales.
