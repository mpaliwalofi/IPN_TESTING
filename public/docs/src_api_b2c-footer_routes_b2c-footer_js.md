# b2c-footer.js

**Path**: `src\api\b2c-footer\routes\b2c-footer.js`

## Summary
This code defines a router for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) footer content type in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory function to automatically generate standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) REST API endpoints for managing footer content that would be displayed on a B2C website. The router enables frontend applications to fetch and manipulate footer-related data such as links, copyright information, and other footer elements through standardized API routes.
