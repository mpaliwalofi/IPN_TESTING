## Summary
This code defines a Strapi service for managing B2C (Business-to-Consumer) footer content through the CMS. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to create a core service that handles CRUD operations and business logic for the b2c-footer content type, which likely stores footer information (links, copyright, contact details, etc.) displayed on a B2C website.
