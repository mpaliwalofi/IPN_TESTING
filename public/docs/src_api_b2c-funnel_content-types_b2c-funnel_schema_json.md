## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) checkout funnel content type that manages the multi-step purchase flow. It defines a localized, single-type collection with two main dynamic zones: `shippingStep` and `paymentStep`, each configurable with various content components like carousels, editorials, FAQs, reviews, and CTAs. The schema enables content managers to customize and internationalize the shipping and payment pages of the e-commerce funnel with rich, modular content blocks.
