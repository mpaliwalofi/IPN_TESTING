## Summary
This file defines a REST API router for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) funnel content type in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory function to automatically generate standard CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete) for managing B2C funnel data, which likely tracks or manages the customer journey/conversion funnel for business-to-consumer interactions.
