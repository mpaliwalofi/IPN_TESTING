**Path**: `src\api\b2c-funnel\services\b2c-funnel.js`

## Summary
This code defines a Strapi CMS service for managing B2C (Business-to-Consumer) funnel data, which likely tracks customer journey stages from awareness to conversion. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to create a core service with standard CRUD operations for the 'b2c-funnel' content type. This service acts as the business logic layer between the API controllers and the database, enabling the application to manage and track customer acquisition funnels for B2C operations.
