## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a B2C website header configuration. It defines a single-type content model that manages header elements including promotional banners (desktop/mobile variants with toggle flags and rich text content), navigation menus (both legacy and light versions using a custom menu plugin), and contact information like phone numbers. The schema supports internationalization (i18n) with localized content for most fields, allowing the header configuration to be managed per locale while sharing some common data like phone numbers across languages.
