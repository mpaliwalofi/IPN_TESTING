# b2c-header.js

**Path**: `src\api\b2c-header\routes\b2c-header.js`

## Summary
This code defines a Strapi router for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) header API endpoint. It uses Strapi's factory method to automatically generate standard CRUD routes (create, read, update, delete) for managing B2C header content, which likely controls navigation and branding elements displayed at the top of a consumer-facing website or application.
