## Summary
This file defines lifecycle hooks for the B2C homepage content type in Strapi. It automatically triggers the localization service from the "import-akeneo" plugin whenever a B2C homepage entry is created or updated, ensuring that homepage content is properly localized across different languages or regions after any content changes.
