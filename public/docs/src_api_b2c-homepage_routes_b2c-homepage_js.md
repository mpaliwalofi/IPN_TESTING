## Summary
This code defines a Strapi router for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) homepage content type. It uses Strapi's factory function to automatically generate standard RESTful API endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for managing homepage content, enabling CRUD operations on B2C homepage data through the CMS's API layer.
