## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a B2C ingredient content type that manages ingredient data for consumer-facing applications. It defines a collection with four attributes: a required image (media file), a title, an optional description, and a unique identifier (uid) that auto-generates from the title field. The schema is configured without draft/publish workflow, suggesting ingredients are published immediately upon creation.
