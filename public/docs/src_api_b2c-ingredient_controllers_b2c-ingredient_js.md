## Summary
This file defines a Strapi controller for managing B2C (Business-to-Consumer) ingredient data through the API. It creates a standard CRUD controller using Strapi's factory pattern, which automatically provides REST endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting ingredient records that are likely used in a consumer-facing food or recipe application.
