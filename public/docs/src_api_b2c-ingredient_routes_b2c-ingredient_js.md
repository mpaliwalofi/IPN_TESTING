## Summary
This file defines a Strapi router for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) ingredient API endpoint. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) routes for managing ingredient data that is exposed to consumer-facing applications. The router handles HTTP requests for ingredient resources following Strapi's conventional REST API structure.
