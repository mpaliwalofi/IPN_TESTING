## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema configuration file that defines a single-type content model for managing B2C international configurations. It provides a localized structure to store country-specific data through a repeatable "Countries" component using href-lang elements, likely for managing international SEO and multi-country website configurations with draft/publish workflow support.
