## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a B2C landing page collection type that enables dynamic, internationalized marketing pages. The schema supports draft/publish workflows and i18n localization, with a flexible content structure including OpenGraph metadata, a header component, and a dynamic zone that can contain 30+ different content components (carousels, CTAs, forms, FAQs, reviews, etc.). It serves as the data model for creating customizable landing pages in an e-commerce or marketing context where content needs to be managed across multiple languages and published states.
