## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema configuration file that defines a single-type content structure for managing B2C (Business-to-Consumer) Large Language Model (LLM) configurations. The schema allows for multiple, repeatable LLM component entries with internationalization (i18n) support, enabling localized content management across different languages. It's designed to store and organize LLM-related settings or configurations for B2C applications without draft/publish workflow functionality.
