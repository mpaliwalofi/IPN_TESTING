## Summary
This file implements a Strapi controller for the b2c-llm (Business-to-Consumer Language Model) API endpoint. It provides a single `getLLM()` method that retrieves LLM-related data by calling the corresponding service layer, handling the response, and returning either the data payload or a bad request error based on the operation status.
