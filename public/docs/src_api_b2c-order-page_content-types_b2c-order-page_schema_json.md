## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema configuration file that defines the content structure for a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) order page in French ("Ma Commande" means "My Order"). The schema specifies a single-type content model with a dynamic zone that can include various order-related components such as order cards, invoices, products, payments, shipping details, and billing information, along with supporting elements like carousels, FAQs, and cross-sell features. It enables content editors to build flexible order tracking and account management pages by composing different pre-defined UI components.
