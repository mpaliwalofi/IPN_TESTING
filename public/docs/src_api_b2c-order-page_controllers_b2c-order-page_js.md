## Summary
This Strapi controller manages the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) order page content by retrieving and transforming single-type entity data with deep population of related fields. It handles the `find` operation by fetching the order page configuration, sanitizing the output, applying cross-sell transformations (likely for product recommendations or upsells), and returning the fully populated response for rendering the order page interface.
