## Summary
This file defines a Strapi service for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) order page content type. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to create a core service with default CRUD operations for managing order page data in the CMS, enabling the API to handle queries and mutations for B2C order-related content without requiring custom business logic.
