## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema configuration file that defines the content structure for a B2C "My Orders" page (Mes Commandes in French). It specifies two required rich-text headers (one for when orders exist, one for when they don't) and two dynamic content zones that can contain various reusable components like order lists, account summaries, carousels, FAQs, and other B2C-specific UI elements. The schema supports draft/publish workflows and is designed as a single-type content model for managing the orders page layout and content in an e-commerce application.
