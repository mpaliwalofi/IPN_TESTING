## Summary
This controller manages the retrieval and presentation of a B2C orders page in a Strapi CMS application. It fetches the page content with deep population of related data, sanitizes the output, and applies cross-sell product transformations to both the main content and "no_content" sections before returning the structured response for customer-facing order pages.
