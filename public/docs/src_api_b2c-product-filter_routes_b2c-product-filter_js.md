## Summary
This file defines a RESTful API router for managing B2C (Business-to-Consumer) product filtering functionality in a Strapi application. It uses Strapi's factory method to automatically generate standard CRUD routes (create, read, update, delete) for the b2c-product-filter content type, enabling frontend applications to query and manage product filter configurations for customer-facing e-commerce features.
