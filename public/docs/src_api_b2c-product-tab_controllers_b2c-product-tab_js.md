## Summary
This file defines a Strapi controller for managing B2C (Business-to-Consumer) product tabs in an e-commerce or product catalog system. It creates a standard CRUD controller using Strapi's factory pattern, which automatically provides RESTful API endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting product tab content that would be displayed on B2C product pages. The controller serves as the interface layer between HTTP requests and the underlying b2c-product-tab content type, enabling frontend applications to manage product tab information through API calls.
