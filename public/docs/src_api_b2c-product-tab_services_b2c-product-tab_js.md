## Summary
This file defines a Strapi CMS service for managing B2C (Business-to-Consumer) product tabs, which are likely used to organize and display product information in different categorized sections on a customer-facing e-commerce interface. The service uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate CRUD operations and business logic for the b2c-product-tab content type, enabling the management of tabbed product displays without requiring custom service implementation.
