**Path**: `src\api\b2c-product-tag\routes\b2c-product-tag.js`

## Summary
This code defines a router for managing B2C (Business-to-Consumer) product tags in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory function to automatically generate standard CRUD API endpoints (create, read, update, delete) for the b2c-product-tag content type, enabling clients to perform operations on product tags used for categorizing or labeling consumer-facing products.
