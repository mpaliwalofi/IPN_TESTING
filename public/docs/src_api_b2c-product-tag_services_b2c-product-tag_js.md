## Summary
This file defines a Strapi service for managing B2C product tags in an e-commerce system. It creates a standard CRUD service using Strapi's factory pattern to handle business logic operations (create, read, update, delete) for product tags that can be used to categorize or label products in a business-to-consumer context. The service acts as an intermediary layer between the API controllers and the database, providing reusable methods for tag-related operations.
