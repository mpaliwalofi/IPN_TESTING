## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a B2C product collection that manages pet products (dogs, cats, and other animals). The schema defines a multilingual (i18n) content type with draft/publish workflow, containing product attributes like SKU, title, slug, classification (e.g., dog/cat food, treats, shampoos, litter), product type, and multiple description components. It serves as the data model for an e-commerce system selling pet-related products with support for localization and SEO metadata (OpenGraph).
