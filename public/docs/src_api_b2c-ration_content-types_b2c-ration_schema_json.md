## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) rations content type that manages product rationing or allocation data. The schema defines a localized collection with a unique reference identifier (`ref`) and a JSON field (`ration`) that stores the actual rationing configuration, with both supporting internationalization (i18n). This allows the system to control and manage customer purchase limits or product allocation rules across different languages/locales without draft/publish workflows.
