## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema configuration file that defines a single-type content model for B2C (Business-to-Consumer) recommendations. The schema supports internationalization (i18n) and draft/publish workflows, with a flexible JSON field called "params" to store recommendation configuration data. It serves as the data structure for managing customer-facing product or content recommendations in a localized e-commerce or marketing context.
