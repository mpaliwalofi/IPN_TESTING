## Summary
This JSON schema defines a Strapi content type for a B2C search page configuration ("Page Rechercher") that manages Algolia search functionality. It configures multiple search indices (articles, categories, products, and product suggestions) with enable/disable toggles for each, supports internationalization and draft/publish workflows, and includes dynamic content zones for various UI components like carousels, FAQs, and instant search widgets. The schema serves as the data model for a customizable search results page in an e-commerce application.
