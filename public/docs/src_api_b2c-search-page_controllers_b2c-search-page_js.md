## Summary
This controller manages the B2C (business-to-consumer) search page endpoint in a Strapi CMS application. It retrieves and processes the search page content by deeply populating related data, sanitizing the output, transforming the response format, and enriching it with cross-sell product recommendations before returning it to the client.
