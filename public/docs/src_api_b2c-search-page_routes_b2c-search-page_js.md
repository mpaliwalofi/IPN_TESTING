## Summary
This file defines a REST API router for managing B2C (Business-to-Consumer) search page content in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate standard CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete) for the b2c-search-page content type, allowing frontend applications to fetch and manage search page configuration and content through the API.
