## Summary
This file defines a REST API router for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) shop page content type in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory function to automatically generate standard CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete) for managing B2C shop page data without requiring custom route definitions.
