## Summary
This file defines lifecycle hooks for the B2C sponsorships page content type in Strapi CMS. It automatically triggers localization functionality from the "import-akeneo" plugin whenever a B2C sponsorships page entry is created or updated, ensuring content is properly localized across different languages/regions after any changes to the page.
