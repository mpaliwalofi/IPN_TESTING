**Path**: `src\api\b2c-sponsorships-page\routes\b2c-sponsorships-page.js`

## Summary
This file creates a RESTful API router for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) sponsorships page content type in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate standard CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete) for managing sponsorship page content that will be displayed to end consumers. This router enables the frontend application to fetch and manage sponsorship-related page data through the API.
