## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema configuration file that defines the content structure for a B2C subscription history page (French: "Historique de mon abonnement"). It establishes a single-type content model with internationalization support, featuring OpenGraph metadata, an LLM component, and a flexible dynamic zone that can accommodate 40+ different content components ranging from subscription-specific elements (subscription history listing, cross-sell) to generic content blocks (FAQs, carousels, rich content). The schema enables content editors to build and manage localized subscription history pages with draft/publish workflows.
