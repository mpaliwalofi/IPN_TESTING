## Summary
This lifecycle hooks file automatically triggers content localization for B2C subscription pages after they are created or updated in Strapi CMS. It integrates with the "import-akeneo" plugin's localizer service to ensure subscription page content is properly localized across different language versions whenever the content changes.
