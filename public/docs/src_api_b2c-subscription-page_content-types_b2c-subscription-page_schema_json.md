## Summary
This JSON schema defines a Strapi content type for a B2C subscription management page ("Mon Abonnement" - My Subscription in French). It configures a single-type content structure with localized OpenGraph metadata, product subscription index settings, and a dynamic zone that can contain various subscription-related components (billing, delivery, payment, product management, FAQ, etc.) along with other B2C page components like carousels, edito blocks, and cross-selling features.
