## Summary
This file creates a standard Strapi REST API router for the B2C (Business-to-Consumer) subscription page content type. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete) for managing subscription page content, allowing the CMS to serve subscription-related page data to the frontend application.
