## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS controller for managing B2C (business-to-consumer) subscription data. It provides a custom `findLocale` method that retrieves subscription records by either a locale identifier (e.g., "en-US") or a numeric ID, sanitizes the output, and returns the formatted response to support multi-language subscription content delivery.
