## Summary
This file defines lifecycle hooks for the B2C subscriptions page content type in Strapi. It automatically triggers localization of content through the "import-akeneo" plugin's localizer service whenever a B2C subscriptions page entry is created or updated, ensuring that content changes are propagated across all localized versions.
