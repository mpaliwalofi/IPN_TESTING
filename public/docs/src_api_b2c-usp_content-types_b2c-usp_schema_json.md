## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema configuration file that defines a content type for B2C (Business-to-Consumer) Unique Selling Points (USPs). It establishes a localized collection with fields for displaying marketing features including an optional image, an icon selector (with predefined options like shipping, discounts, pet-related icons), primary and secondary text fields, and an optional URL link. The schema supports internationalization (i18n) across all fields, allowing USP content to be managed in multiple languages without draft/publish workflow.
