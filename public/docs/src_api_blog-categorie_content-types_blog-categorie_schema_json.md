## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a blog category collection type. It defines the data structure for organizing blog articles into categories, with fields for name, slug, SEO metadata (OpenGraph, breadcrumb, textSEO), featured images, content pushes, and a many-to-many relationship with blog articles. The schema supports draft/publish workflow and includes localized group filters for categorization, serving as the taxonomy system for the blog content management.
