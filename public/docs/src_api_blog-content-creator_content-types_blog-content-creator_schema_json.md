## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition file that defines the data structure for a "Blog Content Creator" collection type. It establishes the database model and API structure for managing blog author/content creator profiles, including fields for personal information (full name, email, job title), social media (LinkedIn URL), profile picture, and SEO/metadata components (OpenGraph, breadcrumb, LLM). The schema supports internationalization (i18n) for most fields and includes draft/publish workflow capabilities for content management.
