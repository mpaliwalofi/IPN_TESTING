## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a "Blog Content Creators Page" (Contributors Page) single-type content model. It defines a localized page structure with hero images, breadcrumb navigation, OpenGraph metadata, and a flexible dynamic content zone that supports various blog-specific components like article lists, verbatims, product pushes, and rich media content. The schema enables content managers to build and manage a dedicated page showcasing blog contributors with draft/publish workflow and internationalization support.
