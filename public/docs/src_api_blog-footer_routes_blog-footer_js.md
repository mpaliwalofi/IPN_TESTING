# blog-footer.js

**Path**: `src\api\blog-footer\routes\blog-footer.js`

## Summary
This code defines a REST API router for managing blog footer content in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate standard CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete) for the blog-footer content type, enabling clients to retrieve and manage footer data that appears at the bottom of blog pages.
