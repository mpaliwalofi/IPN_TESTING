# blog-footer.js

**Path**: `src\api\blog-footer\services\blog-footer.js`

## Summary
This code defines a Strapi service for managing blog footer content in a CMS. It creates a standard CRUD service using Strapi's factory pattern to handle database operations (create, read, update, delete) for the blog-footer content type. This service acts as the business logic layer between the API controllers and the database, enabling management of footer-related content such as links, copyright information, or social media elements that appear at the bottom of blog pages.
