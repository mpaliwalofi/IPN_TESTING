## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a blog menu content type that serves as a singleton configuration for organizing blog categories. It defines a single-type collection that uses a repeatable "CategoryBox" component to allow administrators to structure and manage the blog's category navigation menu. The schema enables draft/publish workflow and is designed to maintain one global blog menu configuration across the application.
