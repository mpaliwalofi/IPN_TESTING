**Path**: `src\api\blog-menu\routes\blog-menu.js`

## Summary
This file creates a RESTful API router for the blog-menu content type in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate standard CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete) for managing blog menu navigation items, eliminating the need to manually define route handlers for common operations.
