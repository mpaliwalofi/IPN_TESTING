## Summary
This file creates a Strapi core service for managing blog menu data, which handles the business logic layer for blog navigation menu operations. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to generate standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the 'blog-menu' content type without custom extensions. The service acts as an intermediary between the API controllers and the database, providing default functionality for managing blog menu items in a CMS context.
