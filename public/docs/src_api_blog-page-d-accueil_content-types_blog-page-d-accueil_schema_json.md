## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema configuration for a blog homepage content type ("Page d'accueil" means homepage in French). It defines a single-type content model with a dynamic zone that can contain various blog-specific components (featured blocks, article lists, product pushes, ads) and generic components (rich content, images, podcasts, CTAs), along with OpenGraph metadata and LLM integration fields. The schema enables content editors to build a flexible, component-based blog homepage with draft/publish workflow capabilities.
