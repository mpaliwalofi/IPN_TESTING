This code defines a Strapi service for managing the "blog-page-d-accueil" (blog homepage) content type. It creates a core service using Strapi's factory pattern, providing standard CRUD operations and business logic methods for interacting with blog homepage data through the API. This service acts as an intermediary layer between the API controllers and the database, enabling custom business logic to be added for the blog's homepage content management.
