## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for an "Email Sender" collection type that stores sender information for email functionality. It defines a localized content type with two required fields: a name (string) and email address (email), both supporting internationalization (i18n). The schema is configured without draft/publish workflow, suggesting it's used for managing email sender configurations that can be referenced when sending emails from the application.
