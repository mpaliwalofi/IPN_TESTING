**Path**: `src\api\global-animal-type\content-types\global-animal-type\lifecycles.js`

## Summary
This file serves as a placeholder for Strapi lifecycle hooks related to the "global-animal-type" content type. It would typically contain callback functions that execute at specific points in the content type's lifecycle (e.g., before/after create, update, or delete operations), but currently exports an empty object, indicating no custom lifecycle logic is implemented. This is a standard Strapi convention where the file exists to maintain the expected project structure even when no lifecycle customizations are needed.
