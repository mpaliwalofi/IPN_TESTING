## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a global animal type collection that stores internationalized (i18n) animal category names. The schema defines a simple data model with a single required, unique "name" field that supports multiple language localizations. It serves as a reference/taxonomy collection for categorizing animals across the application, with draft/publish functionality disabled for immediate availability of changes.
