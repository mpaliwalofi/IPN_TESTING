# global-animal-type.js

**Path**: `src\api\global-animal-type\controllers\global-animal-type.js`

## Summary
This code defines a Strapi CMS controller for managing "global-animal-type" content types, which likely represents a taxonomy or classification system for different animal categories (e.g., mammals, reptiles, birds) in the application. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to generate a standard CRUD controller with default operations (create, read, update, delete) for the global-animal-type API endpoint. This controller serves as the business logic layer between the API routes and the database model for animal type data that can be referenced globally throughout the application.
