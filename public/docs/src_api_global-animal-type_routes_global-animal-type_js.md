## Summary
This file defines a REST API router for the "global-animal-type" content type in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory function to automatically generate standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for managing global animal type data, which likely represents a taxonomy or classification system for different types of animals across the application.
