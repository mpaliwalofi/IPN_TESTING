**Path**: `src\api\global-animal-type\services\global-animal-type.js`

## Summary
This code defines a Strapi CMS service for managing global animal type entities in the application's API layer. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to create a standard CRUD service that handles database operations (create, read, update, delete) for animal type records. This service acts as the business logic layer between the API routes and the data model, allowing the application to categorize and manage different types of animals as a content type.
