## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a mobile "About" page content type. It configures a single-instance (non-repeating) content structure with internationalization support and draft/publish workflow capabilities. The page uses a dynamic zone architecture allowing editors to compose content using three mobile-specific components: links cards, app version information, and contact footer.
