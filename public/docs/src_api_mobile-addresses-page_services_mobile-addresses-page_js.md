## Summary
This code creates a Strapi core service for managing the mobile addresses page content type. It serves as the business logic layer that handles CRUD operations and data processing for mobile address-related page content in the CMS. The service acts as an intermediary between the API controllers and the database, providing default functionality through Strapi's factory pattern for content management operations.
