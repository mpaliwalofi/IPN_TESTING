# mobile-animal-page.js

**Path**: `src\api\mobile-animal-page\controllers\mobile-animal-page.js`

## Summary
This code defines a Strapi controller for managing the mobile-animal-page content type, which likely handles API endpoints for displaying animal-related information in a mobile application interface. It uses Strapi's factory function to create a standard CRUD controller with default operations (create, read, update, delete) for the mobile-animal-page content type. The controller serves as the intermediary between API routes and the data layer for mobile-specific animal page content.
