## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a single-type content model that manages the mobile "My Animals" ("Mes animaux") listing page. It defines a localized content structure with a background image, title, and two dynamic zones: one for displaying content when animals exist (with animal listings, upsells, blog, and contact components) and another for when no animals are present (with checklist, upsells, and contact components). The schema supports draft/publish workflows and internationalization (i18n) for multi-language support.
