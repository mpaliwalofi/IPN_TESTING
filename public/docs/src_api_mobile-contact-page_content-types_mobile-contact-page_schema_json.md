## Summary
This schema defines a Strapi content type for a mobile contact page as a singleton (single instance) with internationalization support and draft/publish workflow. It configures a dynamic zone that allows editors to compose the page using flexible, reusable mobile components including contact blocks, upsells, blog sections, contact footer, and markdown content. The schema enables content management for a localized mobile contact page experience with modular, drag-and-drop content building capabilities.
