## Summary
This file creates a Strapi router for the mobile-contact-page API endpoint, which handles HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for mobile contact page content. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate standard CRUD routes for managing contact page data specifically designed for mobile applications. This router enables the CMS to serve and manage contact page content that mobile apps can consume via REST API.
