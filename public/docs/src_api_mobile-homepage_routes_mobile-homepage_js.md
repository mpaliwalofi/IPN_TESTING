## Summary
This file defines the REST API router for the mobile homepage content type in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate standard CRUD endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for managing mobile-specific homepage content, enabling mobile clients to fetch and manipulate homepage data through the API.
