## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema configuration file that defines a single-type content structure for a mobile application's "My Information" page (French: "Mes informations"). The schema supports internationalization (i18n), draft/publish workflow, and uses a dynamic zone for flexible content composition with a contact footer component. It serves as the data model for managing localized user information page content in a mobile app's CMS backend.
