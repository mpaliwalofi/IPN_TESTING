## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a mobile application's notifications page content type. It defines a single-type (non-repeating) content structure that supports internationalization (i18n), draft/publish workflow, and uses a dynamic zone to allow flexible content composition with notification cards and contact footer components. The schema enables content managers to create and localize the notifications page content for a mobile application through the Strapi admin interface.
