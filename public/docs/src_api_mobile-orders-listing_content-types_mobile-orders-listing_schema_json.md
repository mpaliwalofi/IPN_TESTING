## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a mobile application's "My Orders" page (Mes commandes in French). It configures a single-type content model with internationalization support and a dynamic zone that can contain various mobile-specific components including last order display, orders listing, markdown content, and contact footer. The schema enables content managers to build and localize the order history page structure for mobile users through a modular component-based approach.
