## Summary
This file defines a Strapi router for the mobile-orders-listing API endpoint, which handles HTTP routing for mobile order listing operations. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate standard CRUD routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for managing mobile order listings in the system. This router serves as the entry point for mobile applications to retrieve and interact with order listing data through RESTful API calls.
