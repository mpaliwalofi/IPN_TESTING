## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a mobile shop page single-type content model. It defines a localized (i18n-enabled) page structure with a dynamic zone that can contain five different mobile component types: shop header, shop information, Booxi integration (likely for appointments), map, and customer reviews. The schema supports draft/publish workflow and is specifically designed for managing the "Magasin" (Store) page content in a mobile application context.
