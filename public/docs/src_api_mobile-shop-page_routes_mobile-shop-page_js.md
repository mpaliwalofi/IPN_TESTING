**Path**: `src\api\mobile-shop-page\routes\mobile-shop-page.js`

## Summary
This code defines a REST API router for the "mobile-shop-page" content type in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate standard CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete) for managing mobile shop page content through the API, eliminating the need for manually writing route handlers.
