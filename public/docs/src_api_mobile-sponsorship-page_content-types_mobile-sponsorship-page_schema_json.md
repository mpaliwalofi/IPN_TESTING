## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a mobile sponsorship/referral page ("Mes parrainages" means "My Referrals" in French). It configures a single-type content structure with a dynamic zone that can contain three mobile-specific components: a mention-me referral widget, contact footer, and markdown content blocks. The schema enables content managers to build and publish customizable mobile sponsorship pages through the CMS.
