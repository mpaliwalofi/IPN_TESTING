## Summary
This file defines a REST API router for managing mobile sponsorship page content in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for the mobile-sponsorship-page content type, enabling mobile app clients to retrieve and manage sponsorship-related page data through the API.
