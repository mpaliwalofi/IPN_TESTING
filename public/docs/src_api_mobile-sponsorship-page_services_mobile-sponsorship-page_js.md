## Summary
This code defines a Strapi CMS service for managing the mobile sponsorship page content type. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to create a standard CRUD service that handles database operations (create, read, update, delete) for mobile sponsorship page data. This service acts as the business logic layer between the API routes and the database, enabling content management for a mobile-specific sponsorship landing page or feature.
