## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a mobile static page content type that supports internationalization (i18n) and draft/publish workflows. It defines a collection structure with localized fields including title, slug, tracking name, description, background media, and dynamic content zones that can contain mobile-specific components like pushes and upsells. The schema enables content managers to create and manage multilingual static pages for mobile applications with flexible, component-based content composition.
