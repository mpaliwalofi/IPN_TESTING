## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for an "OverlaySet" content type that manages multi-layered overlay components for a website or application. It defines a localized collection with separate dynamic zones for desktop and mobile views, where each can contain various overlay layer components (rich content, CTA buttons, "made in" badges, product cards, and reviews). The schema enables content editors to create and manage responsive overlay configurations that adapt between desktop and mobile presentations while supporting internationalization.
