**Path**: `src\api\overlay-set\routes\overlay-set.js`

## Summary
This file defines the REST API router for the "overlay-set" content type in a Strapi CMS application. It uses Strapi's factory function to automatically generate standard CRUD endpoints (create, read, update, delete) for managing overlay-set resources, which likely represent collections or configurations of UI overlays that can be applied to content or media.
