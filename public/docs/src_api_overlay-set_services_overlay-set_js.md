## Summary
This file defines a Strapi service for the "overlay-set" content type, which manages collections or sets of overlays (likely UI overlay components or graphics). It uses Strapi's factory pattern to create a core service with default CRUD operations for overlay-set entities, providing the business logic layer between the API controller and the database model.
