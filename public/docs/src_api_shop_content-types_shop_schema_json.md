## Summary
This JSON schema file defines a Strapi content type for a multi-lingual shop/store management system. It specifies the data structure for storing shop locations with attributes including contact information (title, phone), physical address fields (street, locality, region, postal code), geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude), integration keys (Booxi API, Google ID), and media attachments for shop images. The schema is configured with internationalization (i18n) support, allowing each shop's data to be localized across different languages.
