## Summary
This file defines a Strapi service for the "shop" content type, providing core CRUD operations and business logic for managing shop-related data in the application. It uses Strapi's factory pattern to automatically generate standard service methods (find, findOne, create, update, delete) that interact with the shop model through the ORM layer. This service acts as an intermediary between the shop API controllers and the database, enabling reusable business logic for shop management operations.
