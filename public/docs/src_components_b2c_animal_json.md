## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a B2C "Animal" content type. It defines a reusable component with a single boolean attribute "enabled" (defaulting to true) that can be used within other content types to toggle animal-related features or content. The schema establishes the database collection name, display metadata, and the component's data structure for managing animal entities in the CMS.
