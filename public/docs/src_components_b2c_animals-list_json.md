**Path**: `src\components\b2c\animals-list.json`

## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi component schema for managing an "AnimalsList" feature in a B2C (business-to-consumer) context. The component includes a simple boolean attribute called "enabled" (defaulting to true) that likely controls whether a list of animals should be displayed or active on the frontend. This is a content management configuration file used by Strapi's component system to structure reusable content blocks related to animal listings.
