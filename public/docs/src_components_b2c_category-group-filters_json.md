## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition that defines a "Category Group Filters" data structure for a B2C pet products e-commerce system. It configures filterable product categories with attributes including a title, selectable icon (for pets/products like health, dog, cat, kibble, litter), a primary flag to mark important categories, and a one-to-many relationship to product filters for enabling hierarchical filtering of pet-related products.
