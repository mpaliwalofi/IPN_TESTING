## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi CMS component schema for storing product composition and nutritional information in a B2C (business-to-consumer) context. It specifies the data structure for capturing composition details, constituent ingredients, and metabolizable energy values according to different NRC (National Research Council) standards from 1985 and 2006, likely for pet food or animal nutrition products. The schema supports flexible data storage with text fields for composition and title, a JSON field for constituents, and decimal fields for precise energy measurements.
