## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a cross-sell feature that displays related products from the same category on Product Detail Pages (PDP). It defines a configurable component with two boolean attributes: `background` (to control visual styling) and `enabled` (to toggle the cross-sell functionality on/off), both defaulting to true for immediate use in B2C e-commerce contexts.
