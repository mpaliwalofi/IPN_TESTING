## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a B2C cross-sell feature that allows marketers to display recommended products to customers. The component defines the structure for cross-sell sections with a customizable title, a repeatable list of product items, configurable heading levels for accessibility/SEO, and a toggle to switch between listing and alternative display modes. This enables e-commerce platforms to implement product recommendation functionality that encourages additional purchases during the shopping experience.
