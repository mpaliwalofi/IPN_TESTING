## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component configuration file that defines a "DoubleEdito" content structure for B2C (business-to-consumer) use. It specifies a reusable content block that can contain exactly 2 editorial ("edito") components, enforced through the `max: 2` and `repeatable: true` constraints. This component is designed to display paired editorial content sections, commonly used for side-by-side promotional or informational layouts in e-commerce or marketing contexts.
