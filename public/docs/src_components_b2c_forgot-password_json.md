## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component configuration file that defines a "Forgot Password" feature toggle for a B2C (Business-to-Consumer) application. It creates a reusable content type with a single boolean attribute that controls whether the forgot password functionality is enabled or disabled (defaulting to enabled). This component allows content administrators to manage password recovery feature availability through the CMS interface.
