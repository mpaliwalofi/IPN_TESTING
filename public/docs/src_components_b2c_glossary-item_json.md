## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a B2C glossary item. It defines a reusable content structure with three fields: an image (single media file), a title (string), and a description (string), designed to create standardized glossary entries in a content management system. This configuration allows content editors to consistently add and manage glossary terms with associated images and explanations across the B2C application.
