**Path**: `src\components\b2c\instagram-feed.json`

## Summary
This JSON configuration file defines a Strapi component schema for managing Instagram feed displays in a B2C (business-to-consumer) context. It specifies that the component must contain exactly 5 Instagram images (enforced by min/max constraints) using a repeatable nested component structure. The schema serves as a data model definition for content editors to curate fixed-size Instagram feed sections within the CMS.
