## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema that defines a blog grid layout structure for a B2C (business-to-consumer) application. It specifies a reusable content type that contains exactly 4 blog items (enforced by min/max constraints) and an optional grid title, allowing content editors to create consistent 4-item blog grid sections throughout the site.
