## Summary
This is a Strapi component schema definition for B2C product items. It defines a reusable "itemProduct" component with a single required attribute (SKU) that can be embedded in other content types to reference product inventory items. This component serves as a lightweight product reference mechanism in a B2C e-commerce system, likely used in orders, carts, or product listings where only the SKU identifier is needed.
