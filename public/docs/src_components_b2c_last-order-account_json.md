**Path**: `src\components\b2c\last-order-account.json`

## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi component schema for displaying a customer's last order information in a B2C (business-to-consumer) account interface. It configures fields for toggling the feature on/off (`enabled`), customizing the section title, displaying order cards, and references a nested "last-order" component that likely contains the detailed order data structure.
