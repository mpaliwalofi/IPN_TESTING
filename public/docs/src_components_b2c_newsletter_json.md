## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a B2C newsletter feature. It defines a reusable content type with two attributes: an "enabled" boolean flag to toggle the newsletter on/off, and an "image" field for uploading a single newsletter-related image. The schema allows content editors to manage newsletter configurations within the CMS, likely for displaying newsletter subscription sections or promotional content on B2C web pages.
