# onglets-produit.json

**Path**: `src\components\b2c\onglets-produit.json`

## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi component schema for B2C product tabs, which serves as a reusable content structure for organizing product information into multiple tabs on an e-commerce interface. The component establishes a one-to-many relationship with `b2c-product-tab` entries, allowing a single product to have multiple associated tabs (e.g., description, specifications, reviews). This structure enables content managers to dynamically configure tabbed product presentations without code changes.
