## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component configuration file that defines a reusable "Account Cards" component for B2C order and subscription management. It specifies a data structure with two boolean attributes (`orderCard` and `subscriptionCard`, both defaulting to true) that control the visibility of order and subscription cards in a user account interface.
