# order-billing.json

**Path**: `src\components\b2c\order-billing.json`

## Summary
This is a Strapi component schema definition for B2C order billing functionality. It defines a simple data structure with a single boolean attribute "enabled" (defaulting to true) that likely controls whether billing is activated for customer orders. This component would be used within Strapi's content type system to manage billing configuration for B2C e-commerce transactions.
