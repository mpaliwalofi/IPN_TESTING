**Path**: `src\components\b2c\order-card.json`

## Summary
This file defines a Strapi component schema for a B2C "Order Card" feature that can be enabled or disabled. It serves as a reusable content type component within the Strapi CMS, allowing administrators to toggle the visibility or activation of order card displays in a business-to-consumer e-commerce context. The component is intentionally minimal, containing only a boolean flag to control whether order cards are shown to customers.
