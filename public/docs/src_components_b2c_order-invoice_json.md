## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi component schema for B2C order invoicing functionality. It creates a reusable component called "Order Invoice" with a single boolean attribute that controls whether invoice generation is enabled for orders, defaulting to true. This component is likely embedded in order-related content types to toggle invoice creation on a per-order or configuration basis.
