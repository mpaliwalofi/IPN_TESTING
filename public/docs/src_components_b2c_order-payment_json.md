**Path**: `src\components\b2c\order-payment.json`

## Summary
This is a Strapi component schema definition for a B2C order payment feature. It defines a reusable component with a single boolean attribute "enabled" (defaulting to true) that likely controls whether a payment option is active or available for customer orders. The schema establishes the database collection structure and admin UI configuration (with a price tag icon) for managing payment method availability in an e-commerce system.
