## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for B2C order promotions functionality. It defines a simple data structure with a single boolean field `enabled` that allows toggling promotional features on or off for customer orders. This component likely gets reused across different content types in the e-commerce system to control whether promotions are active for specific orders or order-related entities.
