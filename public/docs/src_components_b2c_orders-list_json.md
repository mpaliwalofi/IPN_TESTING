## Summary
This is a Strapi component schema definition for a B2C "Orders List" feature that can be enabled or disabled. It defines the database collection structure and metadata for managing order list visibility in a B2C (business-to-consumer) context, with a simple boolean toggle to control whether the orders list component is active.
