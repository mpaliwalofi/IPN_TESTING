**Path**: `src\components\b2c\payment-option.json`

## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi component schema for B2C payment options in an e-commerce system. It specifies a reusable data structure with two required fields: a payment method name (string) and an icon identifier (enumeration) supporting common European payment methods like Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, bank transfers (French and Dutch), Bancontact, and checks. This component allows content managers to configure and display available payment methods with their corresponding visual icons in the application's frontend.
