## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a B2C product variant component that models different variations of a product (e.g., different sizes, quantities, or configurations). It defines the data structure for product variants including SKU identifiers, pricing information (regular, tax-free, and subscription-based), inventory status, and display options. The schema supports e-commerce functionality by tracking stock availability, ordering/sorting, EAN barcodes, and special features like subscription pricing and back-in-stock alerts.
