## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a "QuickLink" content type used in a B2C (business-to-consumer) context. It defines a reusable data structure with three fields: a URL string, a name string, and an enabled boolean flag (defaulting to true), allowing content editors to create and manage navigational quick links that can be toggled on/off throughout the application.
