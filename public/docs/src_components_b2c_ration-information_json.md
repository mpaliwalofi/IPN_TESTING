## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for managing ration information in a B2C (business-to-consumer) context. It defines a reusable content type with two fields: a flexible JSON data field for structured ration data and a markdown text field for formatted content/descriptions. This schema allows content editors to store and manage nutritional or product ration details that can be embedded in other Strapi content types throughout the application.
