## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a B2C shipping tracking integration with Shipup (a shipment tracking service). It defines a reusable content type with a single boolean field "active" that likely controls whether Shipup tracking functionality is enabled or disabled for a given context. This configuration file allows content editors to toggle Shipup integration on/off through the Strapi admin interface.
