## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi CMS component schema for managing B2C shop relationships. It establishes a reusable content structure with a title field and a one-to-many relational link to shop entities, allowing content types to associate multiple shops with a single component instance. This component enables content editors to group and reference related shops across different parts of the B2C platform without duplicating shop data.
