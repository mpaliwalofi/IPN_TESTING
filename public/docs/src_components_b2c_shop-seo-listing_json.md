## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for managing SEO listing configurations in a B2C shop context. It defines a reusable content type with two fields: an `enabled` toggle (defaulting to true) for activation control and a required `title` string for the SEO listing display. This component allows content editors to create and manage multiple SEO-optimized product or category listings that can be enabled/disabled independently across the shop interface.
