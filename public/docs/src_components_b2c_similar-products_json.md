## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a "Similar Products" feature in a B2C (business-to-consumer) e-commerce application. It defines a reusable content structure that contains a repeatable list of products, allowing content editors to curate and display product recommendations or related items. The component enforces that at least one product must be included in the list, making it suitable for "customers also viewed" or "you might also like" sections on product pages.
