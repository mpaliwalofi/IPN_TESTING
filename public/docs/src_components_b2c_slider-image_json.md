## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema that defines a reusable slider image component for B2C applications. It specifies two attributes: a required single image media field and an optional one-to-one relationship to an overlay-set, enabling content editors to create image slides with configurable overlays for carousels or sliders in the frontend.
