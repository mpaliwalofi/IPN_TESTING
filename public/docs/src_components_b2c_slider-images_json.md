## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a B2C slider/carousel feature that manages a collection of images. It defines a repeatable component structure that allows content editors to add between 1 and 3 slider images, with each image being a separate "slider-image" component. The schema enforces validation rules ensuring at least one image is required and no more than three can be added to the slider.
