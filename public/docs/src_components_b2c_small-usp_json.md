# small-usp.json

**Path**: `src\components\b2c\small-usp.json`

## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi content type schema for a "SmallUSP" (Unique Selling Point) component used in a B2C e-commerce context, likely for a pet supply business. The schema specifies that each USP instance must have an icon (selected from a predefined list of 40+ pet and e-commerce related icons like "dog_default", "shipping_express", "payment_secure") and optional text, enabling the creation of small promotional or informational elements throughout the website.
