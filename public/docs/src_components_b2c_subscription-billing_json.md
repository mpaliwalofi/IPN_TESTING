**Path**: `src\components\b2c\subscription-billing.json`

## Summary
This is a Strapi component schema definition that represents a subscription billing feature for B2C (business-to-consumer) applications. It defines a simple data structure with a single boolean attribute "enabled" (defaulting to true) that likely controls whether subscription billing functionality is active for a given entity. The component serves as a reusable content type building block within a Strapi CMS for managing subscription-based billing configurations.
