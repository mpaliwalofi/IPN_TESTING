# subscription-card.json

**Path**: `src\components\b2c\subscription-card.json`

## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema that defines a reusable "Subscription Card" content type for B2C (business-to-consumer) applications. The component provides a simple structure with a single boolean attribute "enabled" (defaulting to true) that likely controls the visibility or active state of subscription plan cards in the user interface. This allows content managers to toggle subscription offerings on/off without deleting the card configuration entirely.
