# subscription-frequency.json

**Path**: `src\components\b2c\subscription-frequency.json`

## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi component schema for managing subscription frequency settings in a B2C (business-to-consumer) context. It creates a reusable component that tracks whether a particular subscription frequency option is enabled or disabled through a simple boolean flag. This component likely allows administrators to configure which subscription billing frequencies (e.g., monthly, yearly) are available to customers in an e-commerce or subscription-based system.
