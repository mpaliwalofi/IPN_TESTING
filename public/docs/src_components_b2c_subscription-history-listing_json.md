## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component configuration file that defines a "Subscription History Listing" content type for B2C (business-to-consumer) functionality. It creates a simple toggleable component with a single "enabled" boolean attribute (defaulting to true), likely used to control the visibility or activation of subscription history displays in a customer-facing interface.
