**Path**: `src\components\b2c\subscription-history.json`

## Summary
This is a Strapi component schema definition for a B2C subscription history feature. It defines a reusable content type with a single boolean attribute "enabled" that likely controls whether subscription history tracking or display is active for a user or account. The component is designed to be embedded within other Strapi content types to add subscription history functionality to B2C (business-to-consumer) entities.
