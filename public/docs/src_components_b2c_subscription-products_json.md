## Summary
This JSON configuration file defines a Strapi component schema for B2C subscription products. It establishes a data structure with a single boolean attribute "enabled" (defaulting to true) that likely controls whether subscription products are active or visible in the system. This component serves as a reusable content type within Strapi's CMS for managing subscription product availability across B2C features.
