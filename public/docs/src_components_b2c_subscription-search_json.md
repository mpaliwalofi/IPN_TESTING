## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a B2C subscription search feature. It defines a reusable content type with a single boolean attribute called "enabled" that controls whether the subscription search functionality is active, defaulting to true. This component allows content managers to toggle subscription search capabilities on/off within the B2C (business-to-consumer) section of the application.
