## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi component schema for managing subscription shipping settings in a B2C (business-to-consumer) context. It creates a reusable component with a single boolean attribute "enabled" that controls whether subscription shipping is active, defaulting to true. This component allows content editors to toggle subscription shipping functionality on/off within the CMS for subscription-based products or services.
