## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a B2C subscription total feature. It defines a reusable content type with a single boolean attribute "enabled" that likely controls the visibility or activation of subscription total displays in the application's user interface. This component would be used within Strapi's content management system to allow administrators to toggle subscription total functionality on or off for B2C customers.
