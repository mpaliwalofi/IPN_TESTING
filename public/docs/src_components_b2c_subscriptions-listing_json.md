## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a B2C subscriptions listing feature. It defines a reusable content component with a single boolean attribute "enabled" that controls whether the subscriptions listing is active or displayed. This component likely allows content editors to toggle subscription displays on/off within B2C (business-to-consumer) pages or sections of the application.
