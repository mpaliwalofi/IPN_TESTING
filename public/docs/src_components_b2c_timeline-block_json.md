## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema that defines a TimelineBlock content type for B2C (business-to-consumer) applications. It structures timeline entries with date, title, text, optional media (image/video), URL linking, and SEO controls (nofollow, heading levels), plus a sort_date field for chronological ordering. The component enables content creators to build visual timelines with rich media and customizable presentation, likely for displaying company history, product evolution, or event sequences on marketing pages.
