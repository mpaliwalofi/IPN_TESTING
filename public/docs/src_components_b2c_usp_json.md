## Summary
This is a deprecated Strapi CMS component schema for a B2C homepage USP (Unique Selling Proposition) section that should no longer be used. It defines a content structure containing a USP collection list, editorial content, and visibility controls to show/hide content based on user authentication and subscription status. The component is marked for replacement by a newer "USP Collection List" implementation.
