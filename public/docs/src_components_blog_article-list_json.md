# article-list.json

**Path**: `src\components\blog\article-list.json`

## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi CMS component schema for an "Article List" that structures blog content. It specifies that an article list contains a required, repeatable "ArticleBox" component (for multiple article entries) and an optional "intertitle" component (likely for section headings or dividers). This configuration allows content editors to create organized collections of blog articles with optional subdivisions in the CMS interface.
