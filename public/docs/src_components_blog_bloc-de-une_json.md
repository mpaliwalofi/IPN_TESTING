## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi component schema called "Bloc de Une" (Featured Block in French) for a blog system. It establishes a one-to-one relationship with blog articles, allowing content editors to designate a single featured article for prominent display, typically used for homepage hero sections or featured content areas. The component serves as a content type configuration that enables selecting which blog article should be highlighted as the main featured piece.
