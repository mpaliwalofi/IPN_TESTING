## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a blog intertitle (intermediate heading/title) component. It defines a reusable content structure with two string fields (`part1` and `part2`), likely used to create split or styled headings within blog posts where the title can be broken into two distinct parts for formatting or emphasis purposes.
