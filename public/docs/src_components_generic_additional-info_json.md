## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition that creates a reusable "additionalInfo" content type for storing supplementary information. It defines a simple data structure with two string fields: "name" and "description", which can be embedded in other content types to provide extra contextual details or metadata. This component allows content editors to add standardized additional information blocks throughout the CMS without duplicating schema definitions.
