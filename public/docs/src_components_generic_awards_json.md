## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi CMS component schema for managing award information. It creates a reusable "awards" component with a single text field attribute, likely used to store award names, descriptions, or citations that can be attached to other content types in the CMS. This structure enables content editors to add and display awards or recognitions in a consistent format across the application.
