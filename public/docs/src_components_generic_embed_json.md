# embed.json

**Path**: `src\components\generic\embed.json`

## Summary
This is a Strapi component schema definition for an "Embed" content type that enables embedding external media content (like videos, social posts, etc.) into the CMS. It utilizes a custom oEmbed plugin field to handle fetching and displaying embedded content from various providers, along with an optional background display setting. This component serves as a reusable building block for incorporating third-party embeddable content across different content types in the Strapi application.
