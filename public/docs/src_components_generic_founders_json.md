# founders.json

**Path**: `src\components\generic\founders.json`

## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi component schema for representing company founders. It specifies the structure for storing founder information with two attributes: a `name` field for the founder's name and a `sameAs` field (likely for linking to external identifiers or social profiles following schema.org conventions). This component can be reused across different content types in the CMS to maintain consistent founder data representation.
