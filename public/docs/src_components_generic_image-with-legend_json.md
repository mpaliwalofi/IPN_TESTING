## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema that defines an "image with legend" content type for displaying images with optional links. It supports responsive design by allowing separate image uploads for desktop (`file`) and mobile (`fileMobile`) views, along with configurable URL linking and the ability to open links in new tabs via the `target_blank` attribute.
