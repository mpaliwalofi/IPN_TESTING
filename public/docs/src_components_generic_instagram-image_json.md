## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for Instagram posts that defines the data structure for storing Instagram content. It specifies a single media field that can accept images, files, or videos (non-multiple), allowing content editors to associate one piece of media with each Instagram post entry. The schema serves as a reusable component within Strapi's content type builder for managing Instagram-related content in the CMS.
