# knows-about.json

**Path**: `src\components\generic\knows-about.json`

## Summary
This is a Strapi component schema definition that creates a reusable "knowsAbout" content type for representing topics or areas of knowledge. It defines a simple data structure with a single "topic" string field, likely used to tag or categorize entities (such as people, organizations, or resources) with their areas of expertise or knowledge domains. This component can be embedded in other Strapi content types to track what subjects or topics an entity is knowledgeable about.
