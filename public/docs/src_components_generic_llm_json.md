## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS content-type schema definition for storing Large Language Model (LLM) configurations. It defines a database collection called "components_generic_llms" with two fields: a string-based title for identification and a JSON field to store flexible LLM configuration data (likely API keys, model parameters, endpoints, etc.). This schema enables the CMS to manage and persist different LLM service configurations as reusable components throughout the application.
