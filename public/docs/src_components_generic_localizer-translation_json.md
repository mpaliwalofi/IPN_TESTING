# localizer-translation.json

**Path**: `src\components\generic\localizer-translation.json`

## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi content-type schema for managing database-driven translation configurations. It specifies the structure for storing translation connection details (host, database, user) and mapping between source and target locales, with the actual translations stored in a JSON field. The schema supports enabling/disabling translation configurations through an "active" boolean flag, likely used for multi-database localization management in a CMS context.
