## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition that models business operating hours. It defines a reusable data structure for storing opening/closing times with three fields: a day of the week (enum), opening time (required, HH:MM format), and closing time (optional, HH:MM format), enabling content managers to specify when a business or service is available throughout the week.
