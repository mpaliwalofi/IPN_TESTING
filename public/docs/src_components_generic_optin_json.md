## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for an "Optin" component, typically used for user consent or agreement checkboxes (like newsletter subscriptions or terms acceptance). It defines a reusable content structure with four attributes: a required text field for the opt-in message, visibility and checked state toggles, and a flag to mark whether user interaction is mandatory.
