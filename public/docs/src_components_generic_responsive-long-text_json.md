## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema that defines a reusable "Responsive Long Text" content type for storing device-specific text content. It allows content editors to specify different long-form text versions for desktop and mobile views, enabling responsive content management beyond just responsive styling. This component would be used when different text lengths or phrasings are needed across device breakpoints for optimal user experience.
