## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a "Responsive Short Test" content type that stores different string values for desktop and mobile displays. It defines a simple data structure with two text fields to enable responsive content management, allowing content editors to specify different short text content based on device type. This component would typically be used within larger content types to provide device-specific variations of brief text snippets or labels.
