**Path**: `src\components\generic\special-hours.json`

## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for managing special operating hours or business closures. It defines a data structure with start/end datetime fields and a boolean flag to indicate whether a business is closed during that period. This component would typically be used to override regular business hours for holidays, special events, or temporary closures.
