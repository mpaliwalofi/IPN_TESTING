## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a reusable "Title" component. It defines a simple data structure with a single required string field called "title" that can be embedded within other content types throughout the CMS. This generic component allows content editors to consistently add titled sections across different parts of the application without duplicating field definitions.
