## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a mobile accordion UI element. It defines the data structure for an accordion with a title, subtitle, and repeatable nested content sections (using the "mobile.accordion-content" component). The schema enforces that all fields are required and establishes the database collection name as "components_mobile_accordions" for storing accordion component data in the CMS.
