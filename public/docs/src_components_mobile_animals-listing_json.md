## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a mobile "Animals Listing" feature. It defines a simple reusable content component with a single boolean field (`enabled`) that controls whether the animals listing should be displayed in the mobile interface. The JSON structure follows Strapi's component architecture pattern for managing structured content types in the headless CMS.
