# app-version.json

**Path**: `src\components\mobile\app-version.json`

## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi component schema for managing mobile app version information. It specifies a reusable content type called "App Version" with a single boolean attribute "enabled" (defaulting to true) that likely controls whether a particular app version is active or available. This component is typically used in a headless CMS context to manage mobile application version configurations and rollout controls.
