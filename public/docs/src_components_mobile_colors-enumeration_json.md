## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition that establishes a standardized color enumeration system for mobile UI components. It defines a comprehensive palette of 29 predefined color options including primary/secondary brand colors with variations, utility colors for validation states (valid/warn/error), review ratings, and specialized colors for subscriptions, orders, and tags. The schema ensures consistent color usage across the mobile application by restricting color selection to this predefined set with "primary" as the default option.
