## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a mobile contact block feature. It defines the data structure for a reusable content block that displays contact information with an image, title, subtitle, and a call-to-action button that can either link to an external URL or open in a webview. The component is designed to be toggled on/off and serves as a structured content element for mobile application contact sections.
