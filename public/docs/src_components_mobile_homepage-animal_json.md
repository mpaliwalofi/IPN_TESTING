## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition that configures a "Homepage Animal" content type for mobile applications. It defines a simple structure with a single boolean attribute called "enabled" (defaulting to true) that likely controls whether animal-related content is displayed on a mobile homepage. The schema establishes the database collection name and basic metadata for managing animal showcase features in a content management system.
