## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema that defines the data structure for a mobile homepage header. It specifies three required background image fields (for dog owners, cat owners, and a general background) along with an enabled toggle, allowing the CMS to manage different hero images based on pet owner type for mobile users.
