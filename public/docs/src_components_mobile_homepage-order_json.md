## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition that configures a reusable "Homepage Order" component for mobile interfaces. It defines a simple data structure with a single boolean attribute called "enabled" (defaulting to true) that likely controls whether homepage ordering functionality is active or displayed. This component appears to be used for managing the visibility or activation state of homepage ordering features in a mobile application's content management system.
