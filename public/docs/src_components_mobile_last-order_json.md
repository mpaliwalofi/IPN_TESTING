# last-order.json

**Path**: `src\components\mobile\last-order.json`

## Summary
This is a Strapi component schema configuration file that defines a "Last Order" feature for mobile interfaces. It specifies a simple structure with a single boolean attribute called "enabled" (defaulting to true) that controls whether the last order functionality is activated. This component is likely used within a CMS to toggle the display or availability of recent order information in a mobile application.
