## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a mobile "Links Cards" feature that allows content editors to create a collection of repeatable link card items. The component includes an `enabled` toggle for visibility control and references another component (`mobile.link-card`) to structure multiple link cards as a group, likely used for navigation menus or promotional card sections in a mobile application.
