## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a mobile Markdown content block. It defines a reusable content structure with three attributes: a rich text field for markdown content, a boolean flag to toggle a beige background styling, and an enabled/disabled toggle for content visibility. The component allows content editors to create and manage formatted text sections specifically for mobile interfaces within the CMS.
