## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema that defines a "Médaillon" (Medallion) content structure for a mobile pet owner application. It manages personalized background images for different pet owner types (dog, cat, or mixed owners) along with a title, checklist for non-associated users, and an enable/disable toggle. The component appears to be part of a feature that displays customized visual blocks based on the user's pet ownership profile.
