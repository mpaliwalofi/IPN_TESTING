## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a "Mention Me" mobile feature, likely part of a referral or social sharing system. It defines a simple boolean configuration that controls whether the mention/referral functionality is enabled on mobile devices, with the feature turned on by default. The schema serves as a reusable content type component that can be embedded in other Strapi content structures to toggle this mobile-specific feature.
