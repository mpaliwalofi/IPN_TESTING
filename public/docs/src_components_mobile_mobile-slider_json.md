## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a mobile slider component that defines the structure for promotional carousel items in a mobile application. It specifies required fields including title, text, button configuration (link and text), a background media asset, and controls for content visibility based on user subscription status and webview rendering options. The schema enables content managers to create targeted, interactive slider content that can be displayed to different user segments (all users, subscribers only, or non-subscribers only).
