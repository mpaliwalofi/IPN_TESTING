## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema that defines a "Notifications Cards" structure for mobile applications. It specifies three types of notification cards (email, push, and samples) as non-repeatable nested components, along with an enabled flag to control their visibility. The schema serves as a content model for managing different notification preferences or settings within a mobile app's notification system.
