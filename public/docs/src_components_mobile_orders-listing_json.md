**Path**: `src\components\mobile\orders-listing.json`

## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS component schema definition for a mobile orders listing feature. It defines a reusable content structure with two boolean flags: `with_last_order` (to optionally include the most recent order) and `enabled` (to toggle the listing visibility), allowing content managers to configure how order lists are displayed in the mobile application interface.
