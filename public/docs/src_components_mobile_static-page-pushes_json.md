## Summary
This JSON file defines a Strapi CMS component schema for managing mobile static page push notifications. It establishes a repeatable collection structure that can contain multiple push notification entries (via the "mobile.static-page-push" component) with an enabled/disabled toggle, allowing content managers to configure and control push notifications for static pages in a mobile application.
