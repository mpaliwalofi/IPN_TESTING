## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS schema definition for a reusable "LayerMadeIn" component that displays product origin/manufacturing information. It defines a data structure with two fields: a required image icon and an optional text string, likely used to show "Made in [Country]" badges or labels on product overlays. This component would typically be used in e-commerce contexts to highlight the manufacturing origin of products with both visual (icon) and textual information.
