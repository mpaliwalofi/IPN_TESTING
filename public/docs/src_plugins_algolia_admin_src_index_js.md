## Summary
This is a Strapi plugin registration file for an Algolia integration that extends the Strapi admin panel's content manager interface. It injects an "AlgoliaButton" component into both the list view (actions area) and edit view (informations section) of the content manager, allowing users to interact with Algolia search functionality directly from within Strapi's content editing interface.
