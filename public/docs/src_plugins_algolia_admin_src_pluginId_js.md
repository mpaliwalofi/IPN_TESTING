**Path**: `src\plugins\algolia\admin\src\pluginId.js`

## Summary
This module extracts and exports a normalized plugin identifier from the package.json name by removing common Strapi plugin naming prefixes (scoped packages starting with `@` or `strapi-plugin-`). It serves as a centralized way to reference the Algolia plugin's ID throughout the admin panel code, ensuring consistency between the package name and internal plugin identification.
