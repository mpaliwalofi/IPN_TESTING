## Summary
This is a module entry point that exports the Algolia controller for a Strapi plugin. It serves as a centralized export hub that re-exports the algoliaController, following a common pattern for organizing controller modules in Node.js applications. This allows other parts of the application to import Algolia-related controller functionality through a single, consistent interface.
