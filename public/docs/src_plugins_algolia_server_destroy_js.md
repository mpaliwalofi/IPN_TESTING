# destroy.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\algolia\server\destroy.js`

## Summary
This file exports a lifecycle hook function for the Algolia plugin's destruction phase in Strapi. It serves as a placeholder for cleanup operations that should occur when the Strapi application or the Algolia plugin is being shut down or destroyed. Currently, the implementation is empty but provides the structure for future cleanup tasks such as closing connections, removing event listeners, or clearing Algolia-related resources.
