**Path**: `src\plugins\algolia\server\index.js`

## Summary
This is the main entry point module for an Algolia search integration plugin in a Strapi application. It aggregates and exports all the core plugin components (configuration, lifecycle hooks, controllers, routes, services, and middleware) required for integrating Algolia's search functionality with Strapi's content management system. This structure follows Strapi's plugin architecture pattern, making the Algolia search capabilities available throughout the application.
