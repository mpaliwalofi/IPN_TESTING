## Summary
This is a placeholder module file for Algolia plugin server middlewares in what appears to be a Strapi CMS integration. It currently exports an empty object, serving as an entry point for future middleware implementations that would handle Algolia search service integration tasks such as authentication, request processing, or data transformation between Strapi and Algolia's API.
