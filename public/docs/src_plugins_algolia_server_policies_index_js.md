**Path**: `src\plugins\algolia\server\policies\index.js`

## Summary
This is a placeholder module file that exports an empty object, intended to define policies for the Algolia plugin in a Strapi application. Policies in Strapi are middleware functions used to control access to routes and API endpoints. This file exists as a structural stub where future authorization/authentication policies related to Algolia search functionality would be implemented.
