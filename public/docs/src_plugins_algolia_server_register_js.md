# register.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\algolia\server\register.js`

## Summary
This is a plugin registration module for a Strapi CMS Algolia integration plugin. It serves as the entry point during Strapi's plugin registration phase, where the plugin would typically register its services, controllers, or configuration with the Strapi framework. Currently, the registration function is empty but provides the structure for initializing Algolia search functionality within Strapi.
