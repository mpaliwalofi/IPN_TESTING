## Summary
# Summary

This is a placeholder README file for a Strapi CMS plugin called "custom-menu" that likely enables administrators to create and manage custom navigation menus within the Strapi admin panel. The file currently contains only boilerplate text without actual implementation details, suggesting the plugin is either in early development or requires proper documentation to describe its menu customization capabilities.
