## Summary
This component serves as the visual icon representation for the custom-menu plugin within Strapi's admin interface. It renders a Puzzle icon from Strapi's icon library, which is used to identify and distinguish the custom-menu plugin in the admin panel's navigation or plugin list. This is a standard pattern in Strapi plugins for providing a consistent visual identity throughout the CMS interface.
