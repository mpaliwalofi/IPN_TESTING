## Summary
This code registers a Strapi admin plugin that provides a custom field type called "custom-menu" for building JSON-based navigation menus in the CMS. The plugin integrates with Strapi's Content-Type Builder, allowing users to add a configurable menu field to their content types with options for different menu types (starting with a "full" type option). It uses the BulletList icon and lazy-loads a CustomMenu component for the field's input interface.
