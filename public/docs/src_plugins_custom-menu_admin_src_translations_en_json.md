## Summary
# Summary

This is an empty English translation file for the custom-menu plugin's admin interface in what appears to be a Strapi CMS application. It serves as a localization resource placeholder where English language strings and labels would be defined for the plugin's administrative UI. Currently containing no translations, it needs to be populated with key-value pairs to support internationalization of the custom menu management features.
