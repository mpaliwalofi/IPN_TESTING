# bootstrap.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\custom-menu\server\bootstrap.js`

## Summary
This is a Strapi plugin bootstrap configuration file for the custom-menu plugin that executes during the server's bootstrap phase. It provides a hook for initializing plugin-specific setup tasks, configurations, or services when the Strapi application starts. Currently, the bootstrap function is empty but serves as an entry point for any future initialization logic needed by the custom menu plugin.
