# index.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\custom-menu\server\content-types\index.js`

## Summary
This is an empty module configuration file for the custom-menu plugin's content types in a Strapi CMS server. It serves as the entry point for registering and exporting content type definitions that would define the data structure and schema for custom menu functionality. Currently, it exports an empty object, indicating either a placeholder for future content type definitions or that content types are defined elsewhere in the plugin.
