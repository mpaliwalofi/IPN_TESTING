**Path**: `src\plugins\custom-menu\server\controllers\index.js`

## Summary
This is an index module that serves as the main entry point for the custom-menu plugin's server-side controllers in a Strapi application. It imports and re-exports the `myController` module, following a common Node.js pattern to centralize controller exports and simplify imports for other parts of the application that need to access these controllers.
