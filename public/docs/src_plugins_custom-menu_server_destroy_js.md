# Summary

This is a Strapi plugin lifecycle hook file for the custom-menu plugin's destroy phase. It provides an empty destruction handler that would be called when the Strapi application shuts down, allowing for cleanup operations like closing database connections or clearing resources, though currently no cleanup logic is implemented.
