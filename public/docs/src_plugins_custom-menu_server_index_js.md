**Path**: `src\plugins\custom-menu\server\index.js`

## Summary
This is the main server-side entry point for a Strapi custom menu plugin that aggregates and exports all server-level module components. It serves as a central export hub for the plugin's lifecycle hooks (register, bootstrap, destroy), configuration, and core Strapi plugin architecture elements (controllers, routes, services, content types, middlewares, and policies) to make them accessible to the Strapi framework.
