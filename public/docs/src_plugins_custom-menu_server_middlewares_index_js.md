# index.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\custom-menu\server\middlewares\index.js`

## Summary
This is a placeholder module file that serves as the entry point for server-side middleware functionality in the custom-menu plugin. It currently exports an empty object, indicating that no middleware implementations have been added yet, but the file structure is prepared for future middleware registration. This is a common pattern in Strapi plugins to organize and export middleware components that would intercept and process HTTP requests related to custom menu functionality.
