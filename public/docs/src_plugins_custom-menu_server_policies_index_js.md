## Summary
This is a placeholder module file for the custom-menu plugin's server-side policies in a Strapi application. It exports an empty object, serving as an entry point for defining access control policies that would govern permissions and authorization rules for custom menu operations. Currently inactive, it's structured to allow future implementation of security policies like role-based access control for menu management endpoints.
