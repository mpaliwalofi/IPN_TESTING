**Path**: `src\plugins\custom-menu\server\register.js`

## Summary
This server registration file registers a custom Strapi field type called 'custom-menu' that stores data in JSON format. It serves as the plugin's entry point to integrate the custom menu field into Strapi's content-type builder, allowing developers to add menu configuration capabilities to their content models.
