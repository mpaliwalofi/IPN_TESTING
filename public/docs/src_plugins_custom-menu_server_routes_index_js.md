## Summary
This module exports a route configuration array for a Strapi custom menu plugin, defining a single GET endpoint at the root path ('/') that delegates to the 'myController.index' handler with no authentication policies applied. It serves as the routing definition that maps HTTP requests to their corresponding controller methods for the custom menu functionality.
