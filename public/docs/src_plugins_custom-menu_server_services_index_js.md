**Path**: `src\plugins\custom-menu\server\services\index.js`

## Summary
This is a service module index file for a custom-menu Strapi plugin that serves as a central export point for service implementations. It currently imports and re-exports a single service called `myService`, making it available to other parts of the plugin through a unified services interface. This pattern allows the plugin to organize and expose multiple service modules while maintaining a clean separation of concerns in the Strapi backend architecture.
