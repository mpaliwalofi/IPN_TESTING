# strapi-server.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\custom-menu\strapi-server.js`

## Summary
This is a Strapi plugin entry point file that exports the server-side configuration and functionality for a custom menu plugin. It acts as a simple re-export module that delegates to the main server implementation file, following Strapi's plugin architecture convention where `strapi-server.js` serves as the server-side entry point for custom plugin functionality.
