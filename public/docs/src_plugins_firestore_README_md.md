This is a Strapi plugin designed to publish content from Strapi CMS to Google Cloud Firestore database. It enables content synchronization between Strapi's content management system and Firestore, allowing developers to use Strapi as a backend for managing data that gets automatically published to Firestore for use in applications that consume data from Firebase/Firestore infrastructure.
