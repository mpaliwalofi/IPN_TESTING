## Summary
This is the main entry point for a Strapi admin plugin that integrates Firestore functionality. It registers the plugin with the Strapi admin panel by configuring its ID, name from the package.json, and an Initializer component that handles the plugin's setup and initialization logic. The plugin follows Strapi's standard plugin architecture with register and bootstrap lifecycle methods to integrate Firestore capabilities into the Strapi CMS admin interface.
