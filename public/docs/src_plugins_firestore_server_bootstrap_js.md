# bootstrap.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\firestore\server\bootstrap.js`

## Summary
This is a Firestore plugin bootstrap module for Strapi that provides a hook for server initialization logic. The bootstrap phase executes when the Strapi server starts up, allowing the plugin to perform setup tasks like establishing database connections, registering event listeners, or initializing Firestore-specific configurations. Currently, the implementation is empty, serving as a placeholder for future server startup logic related to Firestore integration.
