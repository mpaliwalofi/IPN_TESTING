# destroy.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\firestore\server\destroy.js`

## Summary
This is a placeholder module for the Firestore plugin's server destruction phase in Strapi. It exports a function that receives the Strapi instance and is intended to handle cleanup operations when the Firestore plugin is being destroyed or the server is shutting down. Currently, it contains no implementation and serves as a hook point for future teardown logic such as closing database connections or releasing resources.
