# register.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\firestore\server\register.js`

## Summary
This file serves as the Firestore plugin's server registration entry point for Strapi. It exports a function that receives the Strapi instance during the plugin initialization phase, allowing the plugin to register its services, controllers, or configurations with the Strapi framework. Currently, the implementation is empty but provides the structural hook for future registration logic needed to integrate Firestore database functionality into Strapi.
