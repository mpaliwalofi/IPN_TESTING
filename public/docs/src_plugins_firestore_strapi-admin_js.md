**Path**: `src\plugins\firestore\strapi-admin.js`

## Summary
This module serves as the entry point for the Firestore plugin's admin panel integration in Strapi. It re-exports the default export from the admin source directory, making the admin UI components and configuration accessible to the Strapi admin interface. This allows the Firestore plugin to extend Strapi's administration panel with custom views and controls for managing Firestore-related functionality.
