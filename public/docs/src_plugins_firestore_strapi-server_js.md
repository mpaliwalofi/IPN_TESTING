# strapi-server.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\firestore\strapi-server.js`

## Summary
This is a Strapi plugin entry point file that exports the server-side implementation of a Firestore integration plugin. It serves as a re-export module that delegates to the actual server implementation located in the `./server` directory, following Strapi's conventional plugin structure where `strapi-server.js` is the required entry point for server-side plugin code.
