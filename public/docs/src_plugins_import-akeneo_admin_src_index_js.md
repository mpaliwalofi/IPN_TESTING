## Summary
This is a Strapi plugin entry point that registers an "Import Manager" plugin for Akeneo data import functionality. It configures the plugin by adding a custom ImageLoader field component, registering a menu link in the Strapi admin panel, and setting up internationalization support for multiple locales. The plugin integrates into Strapi's admin interface to provide import management capabilities, likely for syncing product data from Akeneo PIM system.
