## Summary
This is an empty English translation file for the Akeneo import plugin's admin interface in a Strapi application. It serves as a placeholder for internationalization (i18n) strings that would enable the admin panel to display English text labels, messages, and UI elements related to Akeneo product data import functionality. The file currently contains no translations but exists to support the plugin's localization infrastructure.
