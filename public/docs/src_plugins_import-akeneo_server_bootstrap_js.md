# bootstrap.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\import-akeneo\server\bootstrap.js`

## Summary
This is a Strapi plugin bootstrap configuration file for an Akeneo import integration. It serves as the entry point for initialization logic that runs when the Strapi server starts, allowing the plugin to set up necessary resources, register services, or perform startup tasks related to importing data from Akeneo PIM (Product Information Management) system. Currently, the bootstrap function is empty, indicating either a placeholder for future initialization code or that no startup logic is required for this plugin.
