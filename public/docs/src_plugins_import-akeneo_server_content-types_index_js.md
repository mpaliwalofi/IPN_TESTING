## Summary
This is a placeholder module file for Akeneo import plugin content types in a Strapi application. It currently exports an empty object, serving as an entry point that would typically be populated with Strapi content-type definitions to map Akeneo PIM (Product Information Management) data structures. The file exists to follow Strapi's plugin architecture conventions, where content types define the data models for imported Akeneo entities like products, categories, or attributes.
