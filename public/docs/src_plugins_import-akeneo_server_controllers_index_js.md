## Summary
This module serves as a controller registry for the Akeneo import plugin, aggregating and exporting four specialized import controllers (Akeneo, Localizer, Blog, and Shop). It acts as a centralized entry point for accessing various data import functionalities, likely enabling the synchronization of product information, localization data, blog content, and shop data from external sources into a Strapi CMS system.
