## Summary
This is an empty middleware module placeholder for the Akeneo import plugin in a Strapi-based system. It serves as an entry point for HTTP request middleware that would handle data import operations from Akeneo PIM (Product Information Management) system, though no middleware implementations are currently defined. The file exists to maintain the standard Strapi plugin structure and allow for future middleware additions related to Akeneo data import functionality.
