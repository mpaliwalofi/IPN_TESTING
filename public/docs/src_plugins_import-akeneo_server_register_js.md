# register.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\import-akeneo\server\register.js`

## Summary
This is a Strapi plugin registration file for an Akeneo import functionality. It serves as the server-side entry point where plugin-level configurations, services, content-types, and other components would be registered with the Strapi framework during the application bootstrap phase. Currently, the registration phase is empty, indicating the plugin either has no server-side registration requirements or is a placeholder for future implementation.
