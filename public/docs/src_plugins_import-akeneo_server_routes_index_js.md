## Summary
This file defines the API route configuration for an Akeneo import plugin in a Strapi application. It establishes REST endpoints for importing and managing product data, translations, images, blog articles, and shop information from the Akeneo PIM (Product Information Management) system. The routes support both bulk operations (listing all items) and individual item operations (by UID), with all endpoints currently having no policy restrictions applied.
