**Path**: `src\plugins\import-akeneo\strapi-admin.js`

## Summary
This module serves as the entry point for the Strapi admin panel plugin that handles Akeneo PIM (Product Information Management) system imports. It re-exports the default export from the admin source directory, following Strapi's plugin architecture pattern to separate admin UI code from server-side logic. This allows the plugin to integrate Akeneo import functionality into Strapi's administrative interface.
