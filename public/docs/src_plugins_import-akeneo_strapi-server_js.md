# strapi-server.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\import-akeneo\strapi-server.js`

## Summary
This is an entry point module for the Akeneo import plugin's server-side functionality in a Strapi application. It acts as a simple re-export wrapper that delegates all server-side implementation to a separate `./server` module, following Strapi's plugin architecture convention where `strapi-server.js` serves as the standardized entry point for server-side plugin code.
