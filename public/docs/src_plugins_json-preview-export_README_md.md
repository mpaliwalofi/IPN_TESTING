## Summary
This is a Strapi v4 CMS plugin that provides real-time JSON preview and export functionality for content collections during editing. It displays the exact JSON structure that would be returned by the Strapi API (including the standard `{ data: { id, attributes } }` format) in a side panel within the content editor, allowing users to visualize and copy API responses before publishing. The plugin exists to help content editors and developers verify API output format in real-time while creating or modifying content, with configurable content-type exclusions to avoid performance issues on entities with large dynamic zones.
