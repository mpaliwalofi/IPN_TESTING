## Summary
This is a Strapi CMS plugin entry point that registers a JSON preview and export feature for the admin panel. The plugin injects a `JsonPreviewPanel` component into the content manager's edit view (right-links area), allowing users to preview content entries in JSON format while editing them. It also handles plugin initialization, translation loading for internationalization, and integrates the component into Strapi's content management interface.
