# bootstrap.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\json-preview-export\server\bootstrap.js`

## Summary
This is a server-side bootstrap configuration file for the Strapi JSON preview/export plugin that runs during server initialization. It provides an empty hook function where server-side initialization logic can be added if needed (such as registering routes, configuring services, or setting up database connections). Currently, it serves as a placeholder with no active initialization code.
