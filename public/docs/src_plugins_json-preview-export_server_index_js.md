**Path**: `src\plugins\json-preview-export\server\index.js`

## Summary
This is the main entry point module for the JSON Preview Export plugin's server-side code in a Strapi application. It exports two core plugin lifecycle functions: `register` (for plugin initialization and setup) and `bootstrap` (for runtime configuration and startup logic), which are standard hooks used by Strapi's plugin system to integrate the JSON preview/export functionality into the CMS.
