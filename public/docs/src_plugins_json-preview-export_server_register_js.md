# register.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\json-preview-export\server\register.js`

## Summary
This is a server-side registration file for Strapi's JSON preview/export plugin that currently serves as a placeholder with no implementation. It follows Strapi's plugin architecture pattern where plugins can register server-side functionality, services, or routes during initialization, but is currently empty and awaiting future server-side logic implementation.
