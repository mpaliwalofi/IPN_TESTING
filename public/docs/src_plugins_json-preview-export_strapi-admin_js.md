**Path**: `src\plugins\json-preview-export\strapi-admin.js`

## Summary
This module serves as the entry point for the Strapi admin interface of the JSON preview-export plugin. It re-exports the admin functionality from the nested admin source directory, following Strapi's plugin architecture pattern where `strapi-admin.js` files are used to register admin panel extensions and configurations for plugins.
