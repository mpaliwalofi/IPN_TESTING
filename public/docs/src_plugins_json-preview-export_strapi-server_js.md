# strapi-server.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\json-preview-export\strapi-server.js`

## Summary
This is a Strapi plugin entry point file that exports the server-side functionality for a JSON preview and export feature. It acts as a simple re-export module that delegates to the actual server implementation, following Strapi's plugin architecture pattern where `strapi-server.js` serves as the main entry point for server-side plugin logic.
