## Summary
This is the root routing component for the Pixie plugin's admin interface in a Strapi CMS application. It defines three main routes: a homepage view, a creation form for new items, and an edit form for existing items (by ID), with a fallback error page for invalid routes. The component serves as the main navigation skeleton that determines which page component to render based on the URL path within the plugin's namespace.
