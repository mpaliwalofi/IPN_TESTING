## Summary
This file is an empty English translation dictionary for the Pixie admin plugin's internationalization (i18n) system. It serves as a placeholder or initial template for storing English language text strings that would be used throughout the Pixie admin interface. When populated, it would enable multi-language support by providing a key-value mapping of translatable UI text.
