## Summary
This is an empty French translation file for the Pixie admin plugin. It serves as a placeholder or starting point for French localization strings that would be used in the admin interface of the Pixie application. When populated, it would contain key-value pairs mapping translation keys to their French text equivalents for UI elements, labels, and messages.
