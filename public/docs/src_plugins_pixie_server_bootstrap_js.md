# bootstrap.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\pixie\server\bootstrap.js`

## Summary
This is a Strapi plugin bootstrap file for the Pixie plugin that executes during Strapi's initialization phase. Currently, it exports an empty bootstrap function that receives the Strapi instance but performs no operations. This file serves as a placeholder for future initialization logic such as registering services, setting up database schemas, or configuring plugin-specific startup tasks.
