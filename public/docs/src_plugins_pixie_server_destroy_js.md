# destroy.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\pixie\server\destroy.js`

## Summary
This is a Strapi plugin lifecycle hook file for the Pixie plugin's destroy phase. It serves as a placeholder/entry point where cleanup logic would be executed when the Strapi server shuts down or the plugin is destroyed, such as closing connections, releasing resources, or performing teardown operations. Currently, it exports an empty function with no implementation.
