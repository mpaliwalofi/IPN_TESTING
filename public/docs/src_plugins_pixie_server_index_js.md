## Summary
This is the main server-side entry point module for the Pixie plugin in a Strapi application. It aggregates and exports all core server components including lifecycle hooks (register, bootstrap, destroy), configuration, content types, controllers, routes, middlewares, policies, and services, making them available to the Strapi framework for plugin initialization and operation.
