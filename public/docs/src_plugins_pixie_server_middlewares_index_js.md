# index.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\pixie\server\middlewares\index.js`

## Summary
This is an empty middleware module initialization file that serves as the entry point for the Pixie plugin's server-side middleware exports. It currently exports an empty object, indicating it's either a placeholder for future middleware implementations or will be populated by dynamically loading middleware components from other files in the same directory. This pattern is common in modular Node.js applications where middlewares are organized in a dedicated directory and exported through a central index file.
