**Path**: `src\plugins\pixie\server\policies\index.js`

## Summary
This is an empty module placeholder file for Pixie plugin server policies. It serves as an entry point for exporting policy-related functionality (likely authorization/access control rules) but currently contains no implementation, suggesting either future development or that policies are defined elsewhere and imported here.
