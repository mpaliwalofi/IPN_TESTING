## Summary
This is a Strapi plugin registration module for the Pixie plugin that serves as an entry point during the plugin's registration phase in the Strapi lifecycle. It currently exports an empty registration function that would typically be used to register plugin services, controllers, content-types, or other components with the Strapi framework before the application starts.
