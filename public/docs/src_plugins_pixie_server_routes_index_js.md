## Summary
This file defines HTTP route configurations for a "pixie" plugin that manages campaigns and their associated actions/conditions. It exports an array of route objects that map RESTful endpoints (GET, POST, PATCH) to corresponding handler functions for CRUD operations on campaigns, plus endpoints to retrieve schema definitions for actions and conditions. The routes appear to be part of a campaign management system, likely for marketing automation or similar workflow-based functionality.
