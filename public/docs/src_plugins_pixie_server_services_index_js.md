**Path**: `src\plugins\pixie\server\services\index.js`

## Summary
This module serves as a service layer export file for the Pixie plugin, aggregating and re-exporting the pixie service module. It acts as a centralized entry point for accessing Pixie-related server-side services, following a common Node.js pattern of consolidating service exports through an index file for cleaner imports by other parts of the application.
