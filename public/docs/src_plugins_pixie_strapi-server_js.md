# strapi-server.js

**Path**: `src\plugins\pixie\strapi-server.js`

## Summary
This is a module entry point that re-exports the Strapi server configuration from a local `./server` file. It serves as the main server-side plugin registration point for the Pixie plugin in the Strapi CMS architecture, following Strapi's convention of having a `strapi-server.js` file to define server-side plugin functionality.
