# _form.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\Addressing\_form.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a form for creating or updating customer addresses in a Sylius-based admin interface. It dynamically sets the form action URL based on whether an existing address is being edited or a new one is being created, displays appropriate headers and messaging (including a warning about subscription usage when editing), and provides form controls with cancel functionality. The template uses Sylius UI components and styling to maintain consistency with the admin theme.
