# age.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\Animal\Grid\Field\age.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template displays an animal's age by calculating and formatting the time interval between birth and deletion dates. It renders the age in a human-readable format showing years and/or months (with proper pluralization for years), using translated labels, or displays a dash if no age data is available. This appears to be used in a grid/table view for displaying deceased or removed animals in an animal management system.
