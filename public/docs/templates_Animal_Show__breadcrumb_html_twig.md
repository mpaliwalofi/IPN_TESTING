## Summary
This Twig template defines and renders a breadcrumb navigation component for the animal detail/show page in a Sylius-based admin interface. It creates a three-level breadcrumb trail from the administration dashboard → animals listing page → specific animal name, allowing users to track their location within the admin hierarchy and navigate back to parent pages.
