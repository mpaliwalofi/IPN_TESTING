# _contentWidget.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\Animal\Show\_contentWidget.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template displays detailed information about an animal entity in an admin interface, showing the animal's attributes (name, code, type, gender, breed) along with associated customer information. It renders a structured layout using Semantic UI components, presenting the data in a formatted table with translated labels, and includes special handling for crossbreed animals. The template serves as a widget for viewing animal details within what appears to be a pet/veterinary management system built on Sylius.
