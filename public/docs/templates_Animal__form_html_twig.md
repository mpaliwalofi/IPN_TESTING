# _form.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\Animal\_form.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a form for managing animal records in what appears to be a veterinary or pet care system built on Sylius. The form captures comprehensive animal information including customer/channel details, identity data (name, type, gender, breed, sterilization status, weight), age information (birthday/age mode), and additional details about the animal's condition, activity level, and features. It uses Sylius's form rendering system with remote URL paths for AJAX-based lookups of customers and breeds.
