# _script.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\Animal\_script.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template provides client-side JavaScript functionality for an animal management form, handling dynamic interactions between form fields like animal type, breed, activity level, age, and birthday. It sets up event handlers that filter activity options based on selected animal type, manages mutual exclusivity between breed selection and crossbreed checkbox, and dynamically updates the breed autocomplete search URL based on the selected animal type. The script also integrates FOSJsRoutingBundle to enable client-side routing for AJAX requests to fetch breed data.
