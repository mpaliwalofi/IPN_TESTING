# create.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\Customer\AutogeneratedPassword\create.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template provides an admin interface for creating new customers with auto-generated passwords in a Sylius e-commerce system. It renders a form that collects customer information including channel selection, personal details (first/last name, email), and optional data (gender, birthday, newsletter subscription), then submits it to create a new customer account without requiring manual password entry.
