## Summary
This Twig template renders a reCAPTCHA testing page within the Sylius admin panel for customer-related functionality. It integrates Google reCAPTCHA v3 by loading the reCAPTCHA API and implementing client-side JavaScript that intercepts form submissions to generate and inject reCAPTCHA tokens with the action 'back_office_test' before submission. The template also includes FOS JS Routing for handling dynamic route generation in JavaScript.
