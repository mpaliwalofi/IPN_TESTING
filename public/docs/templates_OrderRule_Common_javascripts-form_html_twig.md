**Path**: `templates\OrderRule\Common\javascripts-form.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template provides client-side JavaScript functionality for managing order rule conditions in a form. It implements an event handler that automatically triggers a change event on the newly added condition's type dropdown whenever a new order rule condition is added to the collection, ensuring proper initialization of dynamic form fields with a small delay to allow DOM updates.
