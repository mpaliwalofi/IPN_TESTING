# _form.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\OrderRule\_form.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a form for creating/editing order rules in a Sylius e-commerce application. It displays a two-column layout with order rule details (name, description, conditions) on the left and configuration options (channels, enabled status) plus localized error messages on the right. The template supports multiple translations through an accordion interface, allowing merchants to define validation rules for orders and customize error messages shown to customers in different languages.
