**Path**: `templates\PickupPoint\Grid\Field\location.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a pickup point location card that displays an embedded Google Maps iframe showing a specific coordinate location. It takes x and y coordinate data (decimal degrees), displays the location on an interactive map at zoom level 14, and shows the coordinates below the map in DMS (Degrees, Minutes, Seconds) format using a `DDtoDMS()` function for better human readability.
