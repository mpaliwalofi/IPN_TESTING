## Summary
This Twig template renders a formatted pickup point address for display in a grid view within a Sylius e-commerce application. It displays address components (company name, street, province, postal code, city) with conditional rendering for optional fields, and includes a country flag icon alongside the country name. The template is specifically designed for the PickupPoint feature's grid interface to show complete address information in a structured, human-readable format.
