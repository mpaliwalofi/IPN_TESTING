**Path**: `templates\PickupPoint\Grid\Field\pickupOpenings.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template displays the operating hours/opening times for a pickup point in a formatted grid layout. It takes raw opening hours data, formats it using the `formatOpenings` function, and then renders each day of the week as a list item with its corresponding opening hours. The template is designed to present pickup point availability information in a structured, user-friendly format within an e-commerce or logistics system.
