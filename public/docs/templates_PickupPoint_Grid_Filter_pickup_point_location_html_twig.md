**Path**: `templates\PickupPoint\Grid\Filter\pickup_point_location.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a location-based filter interface for pickup points in a Sylius e-commerce application. It provides form fields for latitude, longitude, and radius parameters that allow users to filter pickup points by geographic proximity to a specific location. The template uses Sylius UI theming and organizes these three coordinate-based inputs into a single labeled filter group.
