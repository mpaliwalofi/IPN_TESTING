**Path**: `templates\PickupPoint\Show\_breadcrumb.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template defines and renders a breadcrumb navigation trail for the pickup point detail page in a Sylius admin interface. It creates a three-level hierarchy starting from the administration dashboard, through the pickup points listing page, and ending with the specific pickup point's name, providing users with clear navigational context and the ability to traverse back through parent pages.
