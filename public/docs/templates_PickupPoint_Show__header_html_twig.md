**Path**: `templates\PickupPoint\Show\_header.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders the header section for displaying a pickup point's details. It shows the pickup point's name (with translation support) alongside a map pin icon in a two-column grid layout, followed by a visual divider. This component serves as the title/header for a pickup point detail page in what appears to be a logistics or e-commerce system.
