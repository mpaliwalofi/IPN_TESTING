## Summary
This Twig template renders the admin detail/show page for a pickup point in a Sylius e-commerce application. It extends the standard Sylius admin layout, displays the pickup point's name in the page title, and provides a content block that triggers a template event for rendering pickup point details, allowing customization through the Sylius event system.
