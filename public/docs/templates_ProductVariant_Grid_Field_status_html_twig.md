**Path**: `templates\ProductVariant\Grid\Field\status.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders the status column for product variants in a grid view, displaying three key pieces of information: whether the variant is enabled, its subscription availability status (subscribable, disabled for new subscriptions, or not subscribable), and its inventory information. It uses Semantic UI styling to present these statuses as a vertical list with color-coded labels (teal for subscribable, red for non-subscribable) and appropriate icons to provide quick visual feedback about each product variant's operational state.
