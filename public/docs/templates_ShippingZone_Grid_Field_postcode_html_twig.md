# postcode.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\ShippingZone\Grid\Field\postcode.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a comma-separated list of postcodes for display in a shipping zone grid field. It displays up to 19 postcodes with commas between them, and if there are 20 or more postcodes in the list, it truncates the display and shows an ellipsis ("...") to indicate additional postcodes exist but are hidden for brevity.
