# _script.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\ShippingZone\_script.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template contains JavaScript that manages the visibility of a postcode range field in a shipping zone configuration form. When a "shipping zone member mode" checkbox is toggled, it shows or hides an associated maximum postcode input field, hiding it by default on page load and clearing its value when unchecked. The script enables conditional display of postcode range options based on the selected shipping zone membership configuration.
