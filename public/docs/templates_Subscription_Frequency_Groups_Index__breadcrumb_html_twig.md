## Summary
This Twig template defines and renders a breadcrumb navigation for the Subscription Frequency Groups index page in a Sylius admin interface. It creates a three-level navigation path starting from the admin dashboard, through subscriptions, to the subscription frequency groups section, allowing users to understand their current location within the admin hierarchy and navigate back to parent sections.
