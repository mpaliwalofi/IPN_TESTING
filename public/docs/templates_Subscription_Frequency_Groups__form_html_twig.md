# _form.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\Subscription\Frequency\Groups\_form.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a form for configuring subscription frequency groups, which control how often subscriptions can occur. The form is divided into three sections: frequency setup (label and daily cap), frequency range (minimum and maximum range values), and margin setup (previous and post-day margins), organized in a two-column grid layout using Semantic UI. This configuration likely manages delivery or fulfillment scheduling rules for subscription-based products or services.
