**Path**: `templates\Subscription\Frequency\_form.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a form for creating or editing subscription frequency configurations in a Sylius-based e-commerce system. It displays input fields for frequency code, position (ordering), duration in days, and translatable content (likely name/description in multiple languages) using a two-column responsive grid layout. The template serves as a reusable form component for managing how often subscription products can be delivered or billed.
