## Summary
This Twig template file contains CSS styles for a subscription monitoring calendar interface. It defines the visual presentation of a calendar selector with month navigation controls, and styles a table-based calendar view with enabled/disabled date cells, hover states, and visual indicators for the current date. The styles support an interactive calendar grid where users can view and potentially select dates for subscription monitoring purposes, with distinct visual treatments for editable versus non-editable time periods.
