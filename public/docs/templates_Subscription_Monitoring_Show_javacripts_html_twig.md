## Summary
This Twig template contains JavaScript for a subscription monitoring calendar interface that displays and tracks subscription frequency events. The module initializes a FullCalendar component to visualize monthly monitoring data and implements a sidebar panel that shows detailed daily frequency group information when users interact with calendar events. It handles AJAX requests to fetch event data and daily frequency statistics, with functionality to abort pending requests and display subscription totals and maximum values for each calendar entry.
