# show.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\Subscription\Monitoring\show.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template file serves as the main view for displaying a subscription monitoring page in a Sylius admin interface. It extends the base admin layout and creates a container that triggers a template event (`app.admin.subscription_monitoring.show.content`) to render the actual monitoring content, allowing for modular customization of the subscription monitoring display through event listeners while also including specific stylesheets and JavaScript files for the monitoring functionality.
