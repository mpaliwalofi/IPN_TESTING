# deleteCustomer.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\Ui\Grid\Action\deleteCustomer.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a delete button for customer records in a Sylius admin grid interface. It conditionally displays the delete button only if the customer data has the `isDeletable` property set to true, using the SyliusUi button macro with the appropriate route path and customer ID for the deletion action.
