# storeFilters.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\Ui\Grid\Commun\storeFilters.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template implements client-side persistence for grid filter states using browser localStorage. It captures and restores filter criteria from URL query parameters, automatically reapplying saved filters when users return to a grid view, and manages the accordion filter panel's open/closed state. The code enables users to maintain their filtering preferences across page sessions by storing them with route-specific keys and provides a reset function to clear saved filters.
