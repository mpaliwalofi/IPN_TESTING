# paymentMethod.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\Ui\Grid\Field\paymentMethod.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a UI label displaying a payment method in a grid field. It shows the last payment method used (translated and styled in teal) if one exists, otherwise displays a "none" label, providing visual feedback about payment method status in what appears to be an e-commerce or payment management system.
