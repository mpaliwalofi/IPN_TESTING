# shippingMethod.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\Ui\Grid\Field\shippingMethod.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a shipping method display label for a grid field, likely in an order or shipment management interface. It conditionally retrieves the shipping method from either `lastShipmentMethod` or `shippingMethod` properties and displays the method's code in a teal-colored label, or shows "None" if no shipping method is assigned. The template is designed to provide a consistent visual representation of shipping information across admin grid views.
