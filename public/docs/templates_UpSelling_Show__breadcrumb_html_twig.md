**Path**: `templates\UpSelling\Show\_breadcrumb.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template generates breadcrumb navigation for the "Up-Selling Show" page in a Sylius admin interface. It creates a three-level breadcrumb trail starting from the administration dashboard, through the up-sells listing page, and ending with the specific up-sell item's name, allowing users to navigate back through the hierarchy.
