**Path**: `templates\UpSelling\Show\_header.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders the header section for displaying an up-selling item's details page in an admin interface. It shows the up-sell's name as a page title with an upward arrow icon and provides an "Edit" button that links to the update page for that specific up-sell record. The template uses Semantic UI styling for a two-column responsive grid layout with visual separation via a divider.
