## Summary
This Twig template renders an update form for an "UpSelling" widget in what appears to be a Sylius e-commerce admin interface. The form allows administrators to modify upselling configurations including the widget's name, enabled status, typology, classification, and associated product variants, with submit and cancel actions to save changes or return to the upselling index page.
