# _script.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\UpSelling\_script.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template contains JavaScript code for managing an upselling form interface where administrators can add and reorder product variants. The script handles dynamic addition/removal of variants with configurable limits based on typology (cart vs subscription), implements drag-like positioning functionality via up/down buttons, and automatically updates position values to maintain the correct ordering of upsell items in the form.
