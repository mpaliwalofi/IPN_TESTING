**Path**: `templates\UpSelling\show.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders the admin view for displaying a single up-sell product recommendation in a Sylius e-commerce application. It extends the base Sylius admin layout, sets a page title showing the up-sell's name, and provides a template event hook that allows other bundles to inject content into the up-sell detail page through Sylius's event system.
