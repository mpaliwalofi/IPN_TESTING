**Path**: `templates\bundles\DHAuditorBundle\layout.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template file serves as the base layout for the DHAuditorBundle, which provides audit logging functionality within a Sylius-based application. It extends the main Sylius admin layout and defines the structure for displaying audit logs, including a custom header section and main content area with responsive container widths. The template includes bundle-specific CSS styling and establishes placeholder blocks (`dh_auditor_header` and `dh_auditor_content`) that child templates can override to render specific audit log views.
