**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\AdminUser\_form.html.twig`

## Summary
This is a Twig template for rendering an admin user form in the Sylius e-commerce platform's admin bundle. It creates a two-column responsive layout using Semantic UI that displays form fields for creating or editing administrative users, including general information (username, email, password, enabled status), personal details (first name, last name), and user preferences (locale selection). The template structures the admin user management interface by organizing related form fields into logical sections with dividing headers for better user experience.
