# _script.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Customer\Create\_script.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template contains JavaScript that automatically enables two checkboxes on the Sylius admin customer creation form when the page loads. Specifically, it ensures both the "create user" checkbox (`sylius_customer_createUser`) and the "user enabled" checkbox (`sylius_customer_user_enabled`) are checked by default, overriding any default form state to streamline the customer account creation process by making user account creation and activation the default behavior.
