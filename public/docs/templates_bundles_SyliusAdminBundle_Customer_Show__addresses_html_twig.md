# _addresses.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Customer\Show\_addresses.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a customer's addresses section in the Sylius admin panel. It displays a scrollable table listing all addresses associated with a customer, showing fields like ID, alias, name, company, street details, postal code, city, phone number, default status, creation date, and available actions. If the customer has no addresses, it displays an empty state message instead of the table.
