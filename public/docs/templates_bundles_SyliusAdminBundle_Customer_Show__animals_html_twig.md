# _animals.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Customer\Show\_animals.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template displays a customer's animals section in the Sylius admin panel. It renders a scrollable table showing each non-deleted animal's details (type, name, gender, sterilization status, age, breed) with action buttons, and includes a "Create" button to add new animals to the customer's profile. The template handles empty states by displaying a translated message when no animals exist for the customer.
