**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Customer\Show\_confirmDeleteAddressUsedInSubscription.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a confirmation modal dialog for deleting a customer address that is currently being used in an active subscription within the Sylius e-commerce admin panel. The modal warns the user about the potential impact of deleting an address tied to a subscription and provides Yes/No action buttons to confirm or cancel the deletion operation. This is a safety mechanism to prevent accidental removal of addresses that are critical to ongoing subscription fulfillment.
