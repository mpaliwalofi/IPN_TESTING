**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Customer\Show\_promotions.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a promotions section within a customer detail view in a Sylius e-commerce admin interface. It displays a table of promotions associated with the customer, showing columns for ID, name, category, coupon, usage count, end date, and available actions, or displays an empty state message if no promotions exist. The template uses Sylius UI components to present promotion data in a structured, tabular format for admin users to view and manage customer-specific promotional offers.
