# _form.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Customer\_form.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders the customer creation/edit form in the Sylius e-commerce admin panel. It organizes customer input fields into a two-column layout covering channel selection, personal details (name, email, group), extra information (gender, birthday, newsletter subscription), and optional user account credentials with password and enabled status. The template conditionally displays account creation options based on whether the customer already has an associated user account.
