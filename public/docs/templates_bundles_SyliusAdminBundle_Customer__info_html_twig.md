# _info.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Customer\_info.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a customer information card in the Sylius admin bundle, displaying key customer details including their full name (linked to their profile), registration date, email address, phone number, and IP address (when available from an order context). If no customer data exists, it displays an "anonymous" label instead, serving as a reusable component for showing customer summary information across various admin panels.
