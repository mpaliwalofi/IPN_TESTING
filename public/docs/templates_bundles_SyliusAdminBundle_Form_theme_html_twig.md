## Summary
This Twig template file extends and customizes form rendering for the Sylius Admin Bundle, specifically for order creation functionality. It defines custom form field blocks for autocomplete widgets (product variants and customers) that connect to AJAX endpoints for dynamic searching and loading, using channel-specific URLs. The template also provides styled UI components for order rule conditions and channel collections, implementing accordion-style interfaces using Semantic UI CSS classes.
