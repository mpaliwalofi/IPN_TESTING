**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Layout\_security.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders the admin user dropdown menu in the Sylius e-commerce platform's admin interface header. It displays the logged-in administrator's avatar and name (or email as fallback), with a dropdown containing links to edit their account profile and log out of the system. The template uses Semantic UI styling for the dropdown component and integrates with Sylius's routing and translation systems.
