# _breadcrumb.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Order\Create\_breadcrumb.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template defines and renders the breadcrumb navigation for the "Create New Order" page in the Sylius admin interface. It establishes a three-level navigation hierarchy (Administration → Orders → New) and uses the Sylius breadcrumb macro to display the trail, with the first two levels being clickable links and the final "New" label representing the current page state.
