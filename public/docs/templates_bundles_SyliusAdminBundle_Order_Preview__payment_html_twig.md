**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Order\Preview\_payment.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a single payment preview item within the Sylius e-commerce admin panel's order details view. It displays the payment method name, formatted payment amount in the order's currency, and a visual label indicating the payment's current state (e.g., pending, completed, failed), using Sylius's macro libraries for consistent formatting of monetary values and status labels.
