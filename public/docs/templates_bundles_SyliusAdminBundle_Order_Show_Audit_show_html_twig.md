**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Order\Show\Audit\show.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders an audit log display for order-related actions in the Sylius admin interface. It creates a scrollable table showing audit trail entries with columns for date, user, IP address, and comments, iterating through audit records and rendering each item using a separate template partial. The component serves as a compliance and tracking mechanism to maintain a historical record of order modifications and administrative actions.
