# _bill.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Order\Show\Summary\_bill.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template displays a billing section in the order summary view of a Syliusadmin interface. It shows the bill's availability date (or "unavailable" if not yet billed) and provides a download button for the bill PDF that is either enabled (if a bill file exists) or disabled (if no bill has been generated yet). The template is part of the order management workflow, allowing administrators to view billing status and access generated invoice documents.
