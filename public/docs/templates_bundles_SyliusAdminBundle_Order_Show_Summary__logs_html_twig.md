**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Order\Show\Summary\_logs.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders the audit log section for an order's summary view in the Sylius admin panel. It delegates to a custom controller action (`GetAuditAction`) that retrieves and displays the audit trail/history of changes made to the specific order entity. This allows administrators to track modifications and actions performed on orders for accountability and debugging purposes.
