# _middleware.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Order\Show\Summary\_middleware.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a middleware integration section in the Sylius admin order detail page, specifically for WebMethods.io integration. It displays the timestamp when an order was last sent to the middleware system and provides a manual "Force Send" button that allows administrators to manually trigger order synchronization to WebMethods.io when needed.
