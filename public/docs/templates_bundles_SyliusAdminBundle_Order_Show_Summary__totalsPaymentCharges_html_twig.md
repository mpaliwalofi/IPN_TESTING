## Summary
This Twig template displays payment charges and their associated taxes in the order summary section of the Sylius admin panel. It aggregates and renders payment-related adjustments (fees/charges) along with their tax components, indicating whether taxes are included in the price or added separately, and formats all amounts in the order's currency.
