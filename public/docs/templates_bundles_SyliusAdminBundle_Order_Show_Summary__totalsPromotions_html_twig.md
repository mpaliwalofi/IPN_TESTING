## Summary
This Twig template displays promotion discounts applied to an order in the Sylius e-commerce admin panel. It aggregates various types of promotion adjustments (order-level, unit-level, shipping, and payment promotions), merges them together, and renders a formatted list showing each promotion's label and discount amount using the money macro for proper currency formatting.
