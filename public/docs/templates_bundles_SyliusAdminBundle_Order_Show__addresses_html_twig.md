**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Order\Show\_addresses.html.twig`

## Summary

It conditionally renders each address section (if present) using a shared address partial template, and provides an "Edit Addresses" button that links to the order update page where administrators can modify these addresses.
