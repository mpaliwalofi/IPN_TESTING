**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Order\Show\_breadcrumb.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template generates a breadcrumb navigation trail for the order detail page in Sylius Admin. It dynamically creates breadcrumb links based on whether the order is in a CART or regular order state, directing users to either the cart index or order index page accordingly, and displays the order ID for carts or order number for completed orders.
