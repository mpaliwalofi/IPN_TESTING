## Summary
This Twig template renders a single order item row in the Sylius admin order detail view, displaying product information along with pricing breakdown including unit price, discounted price, quantity, subtotal, discounts, tax, and total. It calculates and displays item-level discounts by aggregating various adjustment types (order promotions, item promotions, and custom discounts) and formats all monetary values using the order's currency code.
