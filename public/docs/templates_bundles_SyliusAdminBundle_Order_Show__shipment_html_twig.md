# _shipment.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Order\Show\_shipment.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders the shipment details section within an order view in the Sylius e-commerce admin panel. It displays shipment information including shipping method, delivery zone, shipment status label, tracking code (if available), and conditional action buttons for shipping the order or viewing full shipment details. The template also provides a link to track the shipment externally when it's in shipped state, using the shipping method's tracking URL with the shipment's tracking number.
