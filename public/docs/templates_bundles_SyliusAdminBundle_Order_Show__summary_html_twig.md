## Summary
This Twig template renders an order summary table in the Sylius admin panel, displaying order line items with their pricing details (unit price, discounted price, quantity, and totals). It includes both regular order items and free product adjustments, shows order totals in the footer, and provides super admins with a "Force Recalculation" button for non-completed/non-cancelled orders to manually trigger order processing.
