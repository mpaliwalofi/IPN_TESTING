## Summary
This Twig template renders the order update form for the Sylius e-commerce admin panel. It provides functionality for administrators to modify an existing order's shipping and billing addresses, with options to either enter new addresses manually or select from existing customer addresses. The form uses semantic UI styling and includes toggleable sections for address selection, along with CSRF protection and a template event hook for extensibility.
