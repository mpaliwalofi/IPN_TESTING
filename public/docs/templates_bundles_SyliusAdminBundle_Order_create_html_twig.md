# create.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Order\create.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders the admin interface for creating a new order in the Sylius e-commerce platform. It displays a form that allows administrators to manually create orders by selecting a customer and channel, adding order items through a dynamic collection interface, and previewing the order before final creation. The template includes customer information, channel selection, item collection management with custom styling for add/delete controls, and integrates Leaflet maps (likely for shipping address visualization).
