# selectCustomer.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Order\selectCustomer.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template provides the customer selection interface for creating a new order in the Sylius admin panel. It renders a form that allows administrators to select a sales channel and choose an existing customer, or create a new customer with an auto-generated password, as the first step in the order creation process. The template includes JavaScript for dynamic form behavior and uses Sylius's admin layout with custom form theming for the customer selection workflow.
