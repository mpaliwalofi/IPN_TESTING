# update.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Order\update.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template handles the order editing interface in the Sylius e-commerce admin panel. It extends the admin layout and implements client-side functionality for updating order addresses, specifically initializing international telephone number input formatting (using intl-tel-input library) with the order's channel country code as the preferred country, along with postcode validation. The template provides extensibility through Sylius template events for content and JavaScript customization.
