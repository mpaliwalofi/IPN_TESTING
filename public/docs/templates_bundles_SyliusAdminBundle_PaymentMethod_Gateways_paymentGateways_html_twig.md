# paymentGateways.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\PaymentMethod\Gateways\paymentGateways.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a list of available payment gateway options in the Sylius e-commerce admin panel. It iterates through registered payment gateway factories and creates clickable links that allow administrators to create new payment methods using each specific gateway (e.g., PayPal, Stripe), with special handling for PayPal that triggers a consent confirmation dialog.
