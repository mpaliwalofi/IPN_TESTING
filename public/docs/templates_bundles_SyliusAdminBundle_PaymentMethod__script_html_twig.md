# _script.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\PaymentMethod\_script.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template contains JavaScript code that manages the payment method charges configuration interface in Sylius Admin. It handles dynamic form collections for payment charges, synchronizes checkbox states across multiple channel-based configuration items (ensuring the first item's checkbox state propagates to all other channels), and initializes Semantic UI accordion and checkbox components for the payment method configuration form.
