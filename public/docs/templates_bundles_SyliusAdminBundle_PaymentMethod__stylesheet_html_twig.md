**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\PaymentMethod\_stylesheet.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template file provides CSS styling for the payment method charges configuration interface in the Sylius e-commerce admin panel. It styles a horizontally-scrollable form collection where payment charges can be configured across multiple channels, using a flexbox layout with the first item (likely a header column) being wider (330px) than subsequent items (130px). The styles also include accordion-like expandable sections for channel-based charge items and customizes form field layouts with selective label visibility.
