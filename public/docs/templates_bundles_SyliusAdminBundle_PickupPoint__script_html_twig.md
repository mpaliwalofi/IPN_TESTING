**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\PickupPoint\_script.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template implements a Google Maps-based pickup point selector for Sylius e-commerce shipping functionality. It initializes an interactive map with autocomplete address search, manages the display of pickup locations as markers, and handles the toggle between home delivery and pickup point delivery options. The script integrates with Sylius shipping addresses and allows customers to select alternative delivery locations while managing associated billing address requirements.
