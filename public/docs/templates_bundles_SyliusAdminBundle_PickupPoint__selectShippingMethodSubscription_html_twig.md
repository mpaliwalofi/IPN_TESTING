# _selectShippingMethodSubscription.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\PickupPoint\_selectShippingMethodSubscription.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a shipping method selection form for a Sylius e-commerce admin interface, offering two delivery options: home delivery and pickup point delivery. The template provides a tabbed interface where users can switch between entering a standard shipping address (with address selection/creation capabilities) or choosing a pickup point for package collection. It handles form rendering for shipping addresses, pickup point selection, and manages the relationship between decoupled billing/shipping addresses in the order fulfillment process.
