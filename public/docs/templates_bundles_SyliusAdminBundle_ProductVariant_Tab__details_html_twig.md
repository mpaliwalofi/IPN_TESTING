**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\ProductVariant\Tab\_details.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders the "Details" tab for a product variant form in the Sylius e-commerce admin panel. It displays form fields for variant configuration including code, logistics code, shipping settings (category, required status), subscription options (subscribable, disable for new subscriptions), product options/variations, and physical properties (dimensions and weight). The template uses Sylius's UI components and translation system to organize these fields into logical segments for editing product variant attributes.
