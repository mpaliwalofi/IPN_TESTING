**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\ProductVariant\Tab\_inventory.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders the inventory management tab for product variants in the Sylius admin panel. It displays form fields for tracking stock levels (onHand), whether the variant is tracked, stock information, and version control, while also triggering template events for extensibility. The tab provides administrators with the interface to manage inventory-related properties of individual product variants within an e-commerce system.
