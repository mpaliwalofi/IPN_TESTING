# _showInShopButton.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Product\_showInShopButton.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template file serves as an override for Sylius's default admin bundle template that displays a "Show in Shop" button for products. It's part of the Sylius e-commerce framework's admin interface customization, allowing administrators to view how a product appears in the storefront while working in the admin panel. The template is currently empty, effectively removing or disabling the default "Show in Shop" button functionality from the product management interface.
