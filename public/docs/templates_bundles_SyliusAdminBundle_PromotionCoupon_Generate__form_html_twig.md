**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\PromotionCoupon\Generate\_form.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template provides the form UI for bulk generating promotion coupons in the Sylius e-commerce admin panel. It allows administrators to configure coupon generation parameters including prefix/suffix patterns, code length, quantity to generate, and usage constraints (expiration dates, usage limits per coupon and per customer). The template is structured using Semantic UI grid layout to organize the form fields into logical sections for code formatting options and usage restrictions.
