## Summary
This Twig template renders audit trail entries for Sylius promotion entities, displaying a tabular view of historical changes. Each row shows the timestamp, username, IP address, and a summary of the audit action (likely create, update, or delete operations) performed on the promotion. It's part of the administrative interface for tracking and reviewing changes made to promotions for compliance and debugging purposes.
