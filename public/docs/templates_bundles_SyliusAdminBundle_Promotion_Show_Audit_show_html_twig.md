## Summary
This Twig template renders an audit history table for Sylius promotion entities (rules, actions, and coupons). It displays a chronological log of changes with columns for date, user, IP address, and comments, iterating through audit data collections and using a helper macro to summarize each audit entry in a scrollable segment limited to 500px height.
