# _script.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\Promotion\_script.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template provides JavaScript functionality for managing promotion forms in the Sylius e-commerce admin interface. It handles dynamic form behavior including toggling validity date inputs based on a checkbox, showing/hiding coupon-related fields when the "coupon-based" option is selected, and configuring autocomplete dropdowns to be clearable for non-required fields. The script ensures proper UI state management when administrators create or edit promotional campaigns and their associated coupon settings.
