# shippingMethodGateways.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\ShippingMethod\Gateways\shippingMethodGateways.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders a list of available shipping method gateway options in the Sylius admin interface. It iterates through configured shipping gateway factories and generates clickable links that allow administrators to create new shipping methods using a specific gateway implementation (e.g., FedEx, UPS, flat rate). Each link routes to the shipping method creation page with the selected gateway factory as a parameter.
