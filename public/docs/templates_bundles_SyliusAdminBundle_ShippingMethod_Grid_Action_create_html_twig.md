## Summary
This Twig template renders a dropdown button in the Sylius admin interface for creating new shipping methods. The button displays available shipping method types/gateways by dynamically rendering content from the 'sylius_admin_get_shipping_method_gateways' route, allowing administrators to select which type of shipping method they want to create from the available gateway options.
