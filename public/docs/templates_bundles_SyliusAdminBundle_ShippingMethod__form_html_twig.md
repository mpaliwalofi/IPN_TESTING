**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\ShippingMethod\_form.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders the form for creating or editing a shipping method in the Sylius e-commerce admin panel. It organizes form fields into sections including basic configuration (code, zone, category, position), URLs (tracking, icon, pinpoint), gateway/payment configuration, channel availability, category requirements, and tax settings. The template uses Sylius UI macros and custom form themes to provide a structured interface for administrators to configure shipping options with support for multiple channels and translation of shipping method details.
