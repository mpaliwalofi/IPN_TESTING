# _script.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\ShippingMethod\_script.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template contains JavaScript for managing shipping method price ranges in a Sylius admin interface. It validates that price ranges don't overlap by checking min/max values, handles the addition of new price range entries, and manages the display/enabling of shipping costs based on selected calculators and zones. The script ensures proper error handling when price values fall within existing ranges and dynamically updates the UI based on shipping method configuration changes.
