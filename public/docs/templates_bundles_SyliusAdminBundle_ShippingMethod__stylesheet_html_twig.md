## Summary
This Twig template file provides CSS styling for the shipping method range-based pricing interface in the Sylius admin bundle. It handles the visual layout and behavior of a dynamic form collection that allows administrators to define shipping costs across different price ranges, including special styling for the first item (index 0), hiding delete buttons and labels where appropriate, and managing flexbox layouts for horizontal price range display. The styles ensure proper spacing, input widths, and responsive overflow behavior for the shipping method configuration form.
