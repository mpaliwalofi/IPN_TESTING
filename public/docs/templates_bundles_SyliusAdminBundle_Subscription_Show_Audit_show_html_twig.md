## Summary
This Twig template renders an audit log display for subscription management in a Sylius admin interface. It creates a scrollable table showing audit trail entries with columns for date, user, IP address, and comments, iterating through audit records and rendering each item using a separate partial template. The component provides administrative visibility into subscription-related activities and changes for compliance and tracking purposes.
