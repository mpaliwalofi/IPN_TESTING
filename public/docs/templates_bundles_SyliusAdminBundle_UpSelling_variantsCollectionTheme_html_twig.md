**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusAdminBundle\UpSelling\variantsCollectionTheme.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template defines a custom form theme for managing up-sell product variant collections in the Sylius admin interface. It renders a form entry for configuring up-sell variants with fields for selecting a variant, setting date ranges (startDate/endDate), defining pricing (amount/percent), and controlling display order with position controls (up/down buttons). The template is designed to create a structured UI segment using Semantic UI classes for administering promotional or up-selling rules on product variants.
