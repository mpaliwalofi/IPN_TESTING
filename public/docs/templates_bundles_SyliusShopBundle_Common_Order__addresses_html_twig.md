**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusShopBundle\Common\Order\_addresses.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template displays order address information in a Sylius e-commerce shop, showing the billing address and conditionally displaying the shipping address if physical shipping is required for the order. It uses a responsive grid layout and includes a notification message if the billing address is missing (particularly relevant for PayPal transactions), prompting the user to provide the required address information.
