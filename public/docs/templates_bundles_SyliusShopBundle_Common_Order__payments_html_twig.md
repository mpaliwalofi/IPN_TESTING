# _payments.html.twig

**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusShopBundle\Common\Order\_payments.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template displays payment information for an order in the Sylius e-commerce shop frontend. It renders each payment associated with an order, showing the payment method, amount with currency formatting, and payment state labels (unless in 'cart' state), while also handling edge cases like PayPal payments where the payment amount differs from the order total during processing.
