**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusShopBundle\Order\thankYou.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template renders the order confirmation/"thank you" page displayed to customers after successfully placing an order in a Sylius e-commerce shop. It shows a success message with the order details, displays payment instructions if applicable for the selected payment method, and provides action buttons either to view the order in the customer's account (for logged-in users) or to change the payment method/register an account (for guest users). The template is part of the checkout flow completion and handles different scenarios based on user authentication status and payment completion state.
