**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusUiBundle\Layout\sidebar.html.twig`

## Summary
This is a Twig template that defines the base HTML layout for Sylius UI Bundle's admin/backend interface with a collapsible sidebar navigation system. It establishes the structural skeleton with blocks for sidebar, topbar, content areas, and footer, while managing sidebar visibility state through cookies and implementing Semantic UI's sidebar pattern. The template serves as the foundational layout for backend pages, providing responsive design meta tags, flash message support, confirmation modals, and extensible blocks for child templates to override.
