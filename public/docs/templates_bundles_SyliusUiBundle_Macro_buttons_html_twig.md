**Path**: `templates\bundles\SyliusUiBundle\Macro\buttons.html.twig`

## Summary
This Twig template extends the SyliusUI bundle's buttons macro and adds a custom macro for resetting saved filter preferences. It provides a `resetSavedFilters` macro that generates a button which clears stored filter values from a client-side `filtersStore` object, allowing users to clear their saved filtering preferences in admin or shop interfaces. This is specifically designed to enhance Sylius e-commerce platform's UI filtering functionality by adding persistent filter reset capabilities.
