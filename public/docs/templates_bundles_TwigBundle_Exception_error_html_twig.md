## Summary
This is a Twig template that serves as the base HTML layout for error pages in a Symfony/Sylius e-commerce application. It provides a minimal HTML structure with responsive viewport settings, Inter font from Google Fonts, and uses the channel name as the page title, with extensible blocks for title and body content that specific error page templates can override.
