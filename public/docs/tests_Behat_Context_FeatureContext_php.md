# FeatureContext.php

**Path**: `tests\Behat\Context\FeatureContext.php`

## Summary
This is a Behat test context class that extends MinkContext to provide browser automation and web testing capabilities for the application's behavioral tests. It serves as the main feature context where step definitions for Behat scenarios would be defined, though currently it's an empty extension that inherits all functionality from MinkContext. This class acts as the foundation for writing Given/When/Then test steps that simulate user interactions with the web application.
