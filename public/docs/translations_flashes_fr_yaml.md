## Summary
This is a French language translation file for flash messages in an e-commerce application. It contains user-facing notifications for various operations including address/animal deletion, order management (shipping, billing, payments, promotions), and subscription handling (product management, payment retries, card validation). The translations support a business domain that appears to handle online orders with subscriptions, multiple payment gateways (including Checkout.com), shipping carriers, and relay point deliveries.
