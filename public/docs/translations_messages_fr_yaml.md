**Path**: `translations\messages.fr.yaml`

## Summary
This is a French language translation file (YAML format) for a pet food/animal care e-commerce application. It contains localized UI labels and messages for customer-related features including address management (with subscription warnings), animal profiles (breed, age, physical condition, kibble brands), and various form fields. The translations support functionality for managing pet information, delivery addresses, and subscription-based services where address changes require special handling.
