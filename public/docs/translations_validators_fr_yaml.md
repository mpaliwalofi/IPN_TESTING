**Path**: `translations\validators.fr.yaml`

## Summary
This is a French translation file for validation error messages in a pet-related e-commerce application. It provides localized validation feedback for various entities including animals (breed, name, weight), customers (names, locale), and promotions/coupons (eligibility, expiration, usage limits). The file serves as part of the application's internationalization (i18n) system to display user-friendly error messages in French when form validation fails or business rules are violated.
