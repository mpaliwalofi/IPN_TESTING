# vitest.config.base.ts

**Path**: `vitest.config.base.ts`

## Summary
This file defines a base Vitest configuration for testing Vue applications within an Nx monorepo workspace. It configures the test environment with jsdom for browser simulation, sets up auto-imports for Vue, Vue Router, and Vue i18n, enables TypeScript path resolution via Nx plugin, and configures code coverage reporting with the V8 provider. The configuration serves as a reusable foundation for test setups across multiple projects in the monorepo, with global test utilities, standardized test file patterns, and consistent coverage reporting.
