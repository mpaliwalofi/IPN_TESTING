**Path**: `vitest.workspace.ts`

## Summary
This Vitest workspace configuration file defines a multi-project testing setup for a monorepo structure containing an e-commerce application. It configures three separate test environments that share a common base configuration: one for the front-end e-commerce app (`apps/front-ecommerce`), one for a Nuxt e-commerce module (`modules/nuxt-ecommerce`), and one for shared packages (`packages`), allowing isolated test execution across different parts of the e-commerce platform while maintaining consistent test settings.
