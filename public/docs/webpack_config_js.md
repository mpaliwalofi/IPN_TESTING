# webpack.config.js

**Path**: `webpack.config.js`

## Summary
This Webpack configuration file sets up the build process for the Sylius e-commerce platform's admin panel frontend assets. It configures Encore (Symfony's Webpack wrapper) to compile JavaScript and Sass files from both the Sylius AdminBundle and custom admin assets into a production-ready bundle with source maps, versioning, and image optimization. The configuration also establishes module aliases for Sylius UI components and bundles to simplify imports throughout the admin interface codebase.
